            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In ſhort, the ſole motive to theſe few lines was this, Some dear Relations and Friends of his, deſirous that his name and worth might be made known to ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:135216:3"/>as knew him not as it was in the Orb wherein he both moved and ſhined, have importuned this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned character and teſtimony of him. What therefore we have ſeen and heard we teſtifie. While he lived in the Miniſtry he ſhined as an eminent light in this world, holding forth the word of life. His Race while he was in his work was not long, yet did he run his race with great diligence and patience; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripping many. A workman that needed not to be aſhamed, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his talent and province, and fulfilling, I had almoſt ſaid the Apoſtles character, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus when his Lord came, and called him off, he found him
<pb facs="tcp:135216:3"/>doing. Thus he ſhined in all his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and trials, following the Lamb where ever he led him. For the time of my intimacy with him, I found him a man of a choice ſpirit. He was relatively godly as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, Husband, Father. God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed him with rare natural Parts, bleſſed with no ſmall acqueſts both of grace and learning; he was acute, clear, and ſolid in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings; and in his converſe grave condeſcending, communicative, and of an amicable ſweetneſs.

               <p>Q. 2. <hi>There being a Conſcience in every man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by God, how ought every man to imploy his Conſcience in order to God.</hi>

               <p>Though Conſcience be under the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign command, and of the ſole Creation of God, yet hath he ſubſtituted every man to be the keeper of his own Conſcience under him, and muſt ſurrender an account thereof to him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12.

               <p n="2">2. As before God, who, as he made the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135216:8"/>Conſcience, will aſſuredly manifeſt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. 'Tis good to mind her often of her original, and of his omniſcience; which will both quicken her to her employment, and keep her from extreams. Yea, 'tis neceſſary, that all the acts of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and of you toward Conſcience, be done as before the all-ſeeing Creator, leſt they loſe their efficacy and authority upon you, and you loſe your end and attempts upon her, whoſe pravity is ſo deſperate, and policies are ſo deep, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.6. Let her often know from you, that God who created and implanted her, hath a moſt intuitive knowledg therefore of her, and all her intrigues lye open to him.

               <p n="3">3. In the buſineſs appointed her of God. Look, what are thoſe offices, which he hath depoſited with her, and ſee that neither you nor ſhe decline them. Look what are thoſe operations which he hath deſigned by her, and ſee that ſhe do them, and that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly demean your ſelves toward her, [of which <hi>Q.</hi> 4.] God hath ſurrogated and ſet her up. 1. To be a law-giver from him, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy her in the ſtudy and revelation of what his laws are, and your lives ſhould be, and ſee that you receive the truths ſhe dictateth from him. 2. To be a witneſs for and with him; Imploy her in the obſervation and report of his works and your ways, and ſee that you refuſe not the teſtimony ſhe delivereth for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135216:9"/>him. 3. To be a judg under him; Imploy her in the ſearch and determining of your condition; and ſee you remove not the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which ſhe receiveth from him, while you remain in this condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In a befittingneſs and accord to God; who hath inveſted men with it, and imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his mind upon it. 1. In accord to his work herein; Men ſhould not call their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, humour, luſt, illuſion, contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by the precious name of Conſcience.

In accord to his will, as may beſt expreſs his ſuperiority over her, his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude upon her, and beſt exemplifie thoſe ſacred inſtructions, which he hath left upon record concerning her.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beyond and above all for him. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be firſt implanted by him, ſhe ſhould be finally imployed for him. 'Tis a ſordid em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to put Conſcience upon the pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or extenuating of a mans corruption; or upon the proviſion and erecting of a mans credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And 'tis a ſorry end to determine her high-bôrn operations within the narrow confines of the object, ſenſe, or of a mans felf, If ſhe be of an higher efficient, ſhe ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135216:9"/>be buſied for an higher end. Her acts and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers ſhould be all <hi>towards God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.3.21. Men ſhould ſtudy to approve their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to him, to aſſure their Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and to advance and celebrate him by all the <hi>elicit</hi> and <hi>imperate</hi> acts of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 11. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So as to behold, and ſteadily own what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever truths he hath ordered out for man's knowledg and obſervation, by implanting him with a Conſcience. And the more eminent any of them are, the more firm ſhould be mans aſſent to them, and the more full and vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous his adherence to, and aſſerting of them.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. <hi>What great truths may every man know and gather up from hence, that there is a Conſcience in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among and above others, every man may hence know and infallibly conclude theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing verities. Is there a Conſcience in every man? then let every man,</p>

                     </note>. That which may be known of God is manifeſt in them from within,</hi> as well as manifeſt <hi>to</hi> them from without; ſo far at leaſt as will render them <hi>inexcuſable in ſin,</hi> though not as far as may be requiſite and <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to Salvation.</hi> The <hi>eternal power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> are written in lively and legible Characters (not only upon the Creatures, but) <hi>in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> enough to convince the Atheiſt, and whereby he may arrive to the knowledg, both
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135216:10"/>that he is, and (to a good degree) what he is alſo, [<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19.20. 2.14, 15]. The ſeveral truths which are conſerved in the Conſcience, doth ſhe not <hi>dictate as the will of God?</hi> The ſpecial teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Spirit communicateth, doth ſhe not <hi>declare as a witneſs for and with God?</hi> The ſentence and judgment wherewith the Spirit concludeth, doth ſhe not deliver as a <hi>ſubſtitute from, &amp; as the ſentence of God?</hi> I need no other evidence for this, than your own experiences, which do plainly enough acquaint you, that all the <hi>offices</hi> Conſcience doth diſcharge are done under and for God; and that the <hi>obligation</hi> ſhe infers is as from ſo by God, So that the being and acts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are both a pregnant proof that there is a God, and do powerfully perſwade men to acknowledg his Government, and aſcribe him worſhip and glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Behold the Doctrine of Eternity;</hi> rewards of good and evil, that extend beyond death, and all duration of time. Behold your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do not confine themſelves in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with you, within the narrow limits of mortality. They carry engraven on them an immortal ſtate, with accord to the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Souls; and by the proſpect of this, they inhibit and reſtrain from vice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate and rouze us to vertue, refreſh mens hopes at one time, and raiſe fears and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at another. Manifeſt it is, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience principally reſtrains and rules by the hopes and fears of a future immortality of glory and miſery. And if there were no ſuch thing, her government ſhould be for the moſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135216:10"/>part frivolous and deluſory. 2. Gods giving her to many perſons would be vain and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for how ſhould ſhe contain armed force, or artificial fraud, within the bounds of duty, when the one can ſin ſafely, beyond the puniſhments of this life, and the other ſecretly? Beſides, 3. her glory, in being thus capacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and raiſed above the brute Creatures would be hers and our ſhame and miſery, and render her and us beneath them; while her hopes ſhe ruleth by, are fruſtrate, and her fears are vexing. which are things utterly to be rejected by all rational men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Behold a Dooms-day,</hi> or day of judgment. If every man hath a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> then every man muſt give an <hi>accompt,</hi> and come to judgment, and neceſſary it is that the ſeveral judgments of <hi>Conſcience</hi> may be ſet right, and the ſecrets of Conſcience may be revealed and ſet open; [<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12.—17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.] Conſcience is <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicium judicii,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> well. 'Tis an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> of the day of judgment. Conſcience keeps many a Court before hand as a <hi>Judg;</hi> but lo, ſhe conducts men, as by the hand to a more ſolemn and ſupream judgment. Yea, how often doth ſhe cite men hither, and arreſt men from hence! So that <hi>Paul</hi> preaching of Judgment, maketh even a <hi>Pagan Judg to tremble,</hi> Act. 24.25. Plain it is, that the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conſcience refers higher, and reminds men often of a more impartial Judg and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, that is future and certain. Conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the records of Gods Laws and mens lives as a <hi>Book.</hi> Here men often keep this Book claſped
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135216:11"/>and ſealed; but the righteouſneſs of God in and for the reward of men requireth, that the Books be, and they ſhall be opened, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.12. Conſcience is the <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, yea and ſhewing what men are, and have done, as a <hi>witneſs,</hi> whoſe work it is to give evidence in judgment. Here men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>baffle,</hi> at other times <hi>bribe</hi> this witneſs. It ſhall therefore be brought into an open and impartial Court, where it may neither be <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi> nor <hi>frighted,</hi> Prov. 20.27.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Behold Mans Dignity.</hi> If every man hath a Conſcience, than is Mankind advanced in <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> next the very <hi>Angels.</hi> Some of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have being only and no life, others have being and life, but no ſenſe; theſe again have being, life and ſenſe, but no reaſon. But man was created, and is continued with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, life, ſenſe and reaſon likewiſe. Let your condition as <hi>creatures</hi> be conſidered, and you are but little lower than the Angels, [<hi>Pſ.</hi> 8.4. &amp;c.] The nobleſt of brute and inanimate Creatures have <hi>no principle of Reaſon, no power for ſelf-reflection;</hi> they have neither <hi>ſcience</hi> nor <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> You have both of them. Be thankful for, be tender of, improve and juſtifie this <hi>Dignity:</hi> Mind it, maintain it; otherwiſe <hi>this Dignity</hi> will but heighten <hi>your damnation,</hi> and you will be worſe than the beaſts that periſh, who, while men injure and abuſe their Conſcience, imploy and improve their brutiſh knowledg, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>ad finem Pſ.</hi> 49.12, 14, 20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Behold his duty.</hi> If every man hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, then no man is left to a ſinful licenſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135216:11"/>without a check or reſtraint upon him, or to his ſelf-luſts without a command to rule him, without a Controller to reprove him, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to curb and reprehend him.</p>
               <p>What duties are delineated and drawn out upon every mans Conſcience I ſhall not diſcuſs or enquire; though I doubt not to ſay, that there is ſince the fall (at leaſt) a minute-draught left of the Moral law of God upon her: So that he that will not ſhut the eyes of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt needs ſee, that he is under a law, and debt, of religion toward God, of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs toward man, and of temperance and ſobriety to his own ſelf. <hi>The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles which have not the Law are a Law unto themſelves, which ſhew the work of the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 2.14, 15.</p>
               <p>Q. 4. <hi>But what duties hath every man to look to, in that he is not left without Conſcience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, in that every man hath a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he is engaged thereby to look well to the whole compaſs of his duty, and in all things to live honeſtly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. For therefore is Conſcience beſtowed upon him, for the better knowledg of his duties, for binding and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to his duties, and for his better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in and throughout his duties.

Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Subſtitute, and ſet by God himſelf upon the throne of Judicature, doth therefore ſubordinate all to God; all its objects and in all its operations. It eyes God as the ſupream Judg, both of it and of them, in its regular acts and exerciſes. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 139.23, 24. Nor doth Conſcience aſcite either the eſtate or any action into, or ſit upon them in judgment; but as they and it are ſubjected to him, who is ſuperiour to the Conſcience, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the heart, <hi>and knoweth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20, 21. Truth is, when Conſcience acts it ſelf it is ſteered by, and ſubordinated to the judgment of God in its whole judicial proceſs. In the firſt propoſition 'tis ruled by, and ſubjected to the judgment of God, in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:135216:18"/>point of truth; or as to matter of law. In the ſecond propoſition 'tis ruled by and ſubjected to it, in point of teſtimony, or as to matter of fact; and therefore in the third propoſition (which is but a reſult from and upon the two former) there cannot but be a ſubordination and ſubjection ſtill had and made, either virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally or formally, to the ſame righteous and unerring judgment. <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi> ſaith Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in <hi>Joſeph.</hi> As I have done, ſo God hath requited me, ſaith Conſcience in <hi>Adoni-bezek.

               <p>The office of Conſcience then in <hi>general</hi> is to judg, for, from, and under God, which is incluſive of many particular acts, or (as ſome pleaſe to phraſe it) offices, whereof I ſhall give you a ſuccinct view in opening a ſixth Queſtion.</p>

               <p>The Offices of Conſcience are beſt obſerved and opened by a review of the manner of its operation or judgment, which is by way of Diſcourſe, in a practical Syllogiſm, as hath been already mentioned. Let me offer two inſtances more. Thus,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:135216:19"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>All that have the Lord for their God are in an happy or bleſſed eſtate.</item>
                     <item>But I have the Lord for my God. <hi>Therefore,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>I am in an happy or bleſſed eſtate.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>All ſin is to be avoided for it ſelf.</item>
                     <item>But this idleneſs of mine is ſin. <hi>Therefore,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>This idleneſs of mine is to be avoided for it ſelf.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Here are two Syllogiſms which ſhew the manner of Conſcience, its operations, both as concerns my eſtate in the firſt Syllogiſm, and as concerns action of mine in the latter. In each Syllogiſm there are (as you ſee) three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. This is the proceeding of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in all the judgments it maketh. The offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Conſcience are obviouſly pointed us out in and by theſe ſeveral Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>The firſt Propoſition ſtill manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſome general law or rule, whereby I may come to a clear iſſue in judgment, what my actions have been, or elſe ſhould be, and what my eſtate is. Thus Conſcience hath the office of a Law-giver; thus ſhe is to conſerve for us, and (1.) to communieate or dictate to us laws or rules, of general right and verity, as concern our eſtates and actions. And ſo the Apoſtle ſometimes appeals it: <hi>Know ye not</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> do not your Conſciences tell you?) <hi>that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. <hi>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience to righteouſneſs?</hi> Rom. 6.16.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135216:19"/>
                  <hi>i.e.</hi> Do not your Conſciences dictate as much as this? So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14. <hi>Judg in your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Conſcience is appealed to in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral concernment; <hi>Is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</hi> Again, <hi>Doth not even nature it ſelf</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> doth not even natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) <hi>teach you, that if a man have long hair it is a ſhame unto him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) To chalk out and deſcry our liberty. As it is to dictate law, or what muſt be in matters neceſſary; ſo it is to diſcern liberty, what may or may not be, in matters of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency

               <p>I know there are that approve not the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe acts to the account of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But the twofold acceptation of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tendered you (<hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 21.) a more large and in a more limited ſenſe) may ſalve their exceptions. And that ſuch dictates and laws appertain to Conſcience, in the common and received uſage of Conſcience, (which I am particularly concerned to attend) needs no other proof, than the frequency of ſuch ſpeeches among us. My Conſcience tells me, Men ſhould do to others as they would be done by. My Conſcience tells me ſuch and ſuch things muſt be done which are matters of general right and equity. And they that deny ſuch clear and commonly received laws of general right, are in common ſpeech ſaid to offer violence to their Conſciences. So my Conſcience tells me ſuch and ſuch matters
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135216:20"/>may be declined and forborn, which are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of indifferency.</p>

               <p>The ſecond and third Propoſitions ſtill make application of ſome general law or rule (had in the firſt Propoſition) to a mans particular eſtate or actions. Thus it is the office of Conſcience, to apply general Propoſitions and Canons to a mans perſonal and particular caſe and concern. And indeed the <hi>Thomiſts</hi>

               <p>The ſecond Propofition contains the direct teſtimony of Conſcience; and with reſpect to this, the office of Conſcience in general is that of a witneſs. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſuggeſts of his own and touching the Conſcience of the Gentiles,

               <p>The witneſs of Conſcience may be either conſidered, 1. as it is in habit, and reſts upon record. Or 2. as it is in act, or is reduced thereunto: which is by two ſteps. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience caſts back a reflection upon its own records, of our eſtate and actions; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders and ruminates upon them. And then 2. Conſcience comes forth and reports to us, how the caſe now ſtands, or hath ſtood, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to thoſe records, and to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
               <p>The office or act of Conſcience then in reſpect of the ſecond Propoſition, is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To regiſter and book down, what a man is and doth. And in truth, Conſcience is (as one

               <p n="2">(2.) To reflect and bring back to the heart, as the expreſſion of <hi>Solomon</hi> is in the margin of 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.47. Conſcience is to every man, not only as his private Notary, but as his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:135216:21"/>petty-Conſtable, to ſearch into and ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every miſcarrying act and habit. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience reviews its regiſter, recalls and reads over its records.

Conſcience conſiders the matter, <hi>I conſidered in my heart, ſaith the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher;</hi> or, I gave or ſet to my heart, <hi>Hebr. Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1.

Thus Conſcience is by office, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; not only, 1. to tell us or hold forth what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is evil, to us in particular, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the general law in the firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. But 2. to tye and oblige us reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that evil, and to this good, agreeably ſtill to the ſame law in the ſame propoſition. And 3. to thruſt forward, excite or impell us, for the avoiding of that evil, and for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining or doing of this good; with accord ſtill to that general light or law. In relation to theſe Offices, the holy Scriptures ſpeaks of the Conſcientious man, as one ſtirred, as one bound, as one preſſed in his own ſpirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.16, 18.5.20, 22. He is not only a debtor, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14. But there is a neceſſity upon him, as from Gods command, ſo from his own Conſcience. He is conſtrained and cannot chuſe (unleſs he ſhould offer violence to his own Conſcience) but do, what his Conſcience dictates, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9, 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.20.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, that theſe three laſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Conſcience are commonly placed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and conceived to appertain rather to the firſt Propoſition. But in that Conſcience doth therein dictate but the general right or law, and theſe acts do evidently include a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſpect and application to a mans own eſtate or action, and this concluſive as to his eſtate and action: As the operation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience aforeſaid doth obviouſly witneſs.

               <p>Q. 7. <hi>How may and ſhould we ſo order our Conſcience (in relation to the firſt Propoſition) that they offer us true and right Laws and Rules, and none but ſuch concerning our eſtates

               <p>Q. 9. <hi>What courſe ſhould we take touching the recording of things by our Conſcience, in order to their giving a right witneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I can ſay but little here [for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting and review of her Records belongs to the next Queſtion, <hi>Direct.</hi> 1.] Touching the due compiling of them, I ſhall only offer two things, in the caſe. 1. What ſhe doth do, as a motive to incite you. 2. What you ſhould do, as that which may inſtruct you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Remember what ſhe doth. She doth,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct: </seg>1:</label> and cannot but record thy actions, though thou careſt not (happily) to reflect on, or attend to it. Such is her relation unto God, as being his regiſter and notary. So that they are all written before him; yea, laid up in ſtore with him, and ſealed up among his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.34. And ſuch is her relation withal to thee. Conſcience is one
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:135216:32"/>of thoſe books the Scripture ſpeaks of, and thou ſhalt be judged out of thoſe things which are written in this Book, according to thy works. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. She books down thy actions then, and that truly and thorowly. And though through the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of miſts without, and of the mind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou canſt not now diſcern all her prints and characters; yet in the light of ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſtreſs, or ſelf-diſcuſſion, thou mayſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſome of them, (as <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren and <hi>David</hi> did. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6.) and in the light of that great day, they will all be diſcovered. And thoſe Letters on it which now ſeem inviſible and illegible, like Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written with the juice of a Lemon, will be then clear, when it is brought to the fire of Gods judgment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. Yea, as ſhe records them 1. impartially; ſo likewiſe 2. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delibly. Her records are written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a Diamond, they are graven upon the table of thine heart; ſo that there is no obliterating, or razing them out. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>2</label> Remember what you ſhould do. 1. Take care that Conſcience record things as legibly as ſhe can; whereby when you reflect, you ſhall read them over, with leſs averſation, and more attention. To this end 1. Circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is requiſite on your part, not only as to the matter of her records, but as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alſo; that you may not loſe the end of this act or work, by the intricacy of her hand-writing: <hi>In all things that I have ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:135216:32"/>you be circumſpect.</hi> Exod. 23.13. Pſal. 119.9. 2. Knowledg and confidence are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite on her part, wherewith it ſhould be your care to furniſh her knowledg; leſt ſhe record virtue for vice, as <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 20.5, 6. or vice for virtue, as thoſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20. Confidence; for if ſhe writes with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and palſie-hand, ſhe is like to write (if truly, yet) illegibly and leſs accurately. If you menace her, you do but make her write in Characters which you cannot underſtand, without a key to them. Record ſhe will, but ſo as you ſhall not read them, who attempt to rend them, as we have clear inſtance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>to the end.</hi> Give her confidence, and you ſhall not go away without a good accompt. She never records with more clearneſs to us, than when ſhe is treated with moſt confidence by us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 22, 23. (2) Take care to keep theſe records as legible as you can. Men are but too prone to blur and ſully them; either through ſenſuality, they themſelves contract blots and filth upon them; or through ſupineſs they ſuffer others to cloud and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh them. And ſo when Conſcience ſhould be reporting them, men are to ſeek how they ſhould read them. Some let the duſt of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular vanities cover them. So did <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler for ſome years; as if the records of his Conſcience were to reſt there, rather as in a grave then as in a Court of Record, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.1. <hi>cum</hi> 9. Others let the copperas and gall-nuts, or ink of ſin to continue on and canker them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Others let the worms and moths of Satans temptations corrupt them, as did thoſe <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2, 3. Your care then ſhould be 1. to lock them up in a ſafe repoſitory; 2. To look after them, ſo as neither the defilements of ſin, or duſts of ſenſe, or devices of Satan may reach, at leaſt reſt upon them. 3. To look that they be always in readineſs, that they be not to ſeek when you ſhould be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing them.</p>
               <p>Q. 10. <hi>What courſe ſhould we take in and about the reflections of our Conſcience, that they may give us a true and right wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the reflection which Conſcience maketh (at leaſt of actions paſt) ſhe caſteth back an eye upon two things; upon her own records, which are repoſited with the memory, which ſpeaks back what our actions either be, or have been; and upon thoſe holy rules, which are repoſited with the mind or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſpeaks back what they ſhould have been, or now ſhould be. So that Conſcience in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection is both to conſult her own records, and to compare the concern before her, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe is to witneſs with thoſe holy rules. I adviſe then, that you</p>
               <p n="1">1. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>1</label> Send your Conſcience to ſearch her own Records. Here her actions are all bookt (as before, <hi>Q.</hi> 9.) let her reflect hither, remember
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135216:33"/>and read them over, without which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now reach the end, or reap the benefit, of their being ſo repoſited. <hi>Remember this,</hi> how they are enrolled, and why, <hi>Call it again to mind, O ye tranſgreſſors;</hi> to uſe the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.8. Now that you may conſult theſe records aright, and have Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to reflect; Its requiſite that there be (1) Self-denial, without which this work will not be done at all, or not aright; but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience like the unjuſt Steward will be writing fifty for an hundred. For be ſure your wills and affections, yea Conſcience it ſelf (through the corruption that cleaves to it) will be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back from ſuch a difficult and fleſh-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing work; or at moſt will not dwell long upon it. And therefore the Apoſtle doubleth the charge: Examine your ſelves, prove your own ſelves; as knowing how hardly we are brought to it, and how the heart hangs back from it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. (2) Serious deliberation, leſt you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>read and miſunderſtand her records, and the reſult be a miſtake and miſrepreſentation of your caſe; which will miniſter nothing but matter for repentance, as it did unto <hi>David, I ſaid in my haſte, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 31.22. and 116.11. (3) A ſteady diligence; <hi>My ſpirit made diligent ſearch,</hi> Pſal. 77.6. 1. In rubbing up and ranſacking the memory, where theſe records lie, as in their moſt proper repoſitory. For many of our actions lie there, rather as ſo much rubbiſh which we have ſwept out of ſight, then as ſo many records that are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:135216:34"/>orderly ſhelv'd up for a ſurveigh. 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterating this method, our actions many times lie ſo far off, and ſo many things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe between them and the eye of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that there muſt be a raiſed and repeated diligence; yea and giving all diligence, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move other matters, and to reduce them again to our minds. 'Tis therefore called a bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to the heart, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.47. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.8. 3. In the reception and right nicking of the means. The court of records ſtands not always open; and 'tis ill ſlipping the firſt ſeaſon. Now diligence would be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing e're the doors are ſhut; and the draught by Conſcience is yet freſh and unſullied: As <hi>David</hi> ſometimes immediately reflected, upon the cutting off of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, and upon his numbring the people. But at another time, when he yields to his own ſloth, and falls not in with the firſt ſeaſon, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> is murdered, and his Wife conſtuprated by him, &amp;c. and he never caſts a reflex upon either of theſe prodigious acts; yea notwithſtanding the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable came ſo pat and plain upon him, till the Prophet was fain to put himſelf in the place of Conſcience, and tell him, <hi>Thou art the man;</hi> and you know what this negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence coſt him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11, <hi>and</hi> 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>2</label> Set Conſcience by thoſe holy rules, whereon ſhe muſt reflect. The rule is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reflection on, and of as needful reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in witneſs-bearing: For how ſhall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience witneſs or reflect on this as good, or
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:135216:34"/>on that as good? but by comparing this and that with the rule, which can alone reſolve her what is good and what is bad. Now as Gods revealed will is the only rule and meaſure of all moral good and evil; ſo the reflection of Conſcience connoteth a reſpect to this rule. For Conſcience doth not caſt back an enquiry after the phyſical being of an action; as whether I have eat or drunk? but after the moral being of that action, as whether I have eat or drunk to Gods glory, &amp;c. as his law enjoyns me; or elſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, &amp;c. as his law inhibits me? <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.18. Now hereunto theſe three things are requiſite; which though they are not of that obvious neceſſity and diſtinct uſe, in thoſe ſudden and tranſient reflections which Conſcience often maketh; yet are they of very needful obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and uſeful diſtinctneſs in her more ſolemn and abiding reflections in the more ſerious returns we are to make upon our ſelves as before the Sacrament, &amp;c. or when we undertake the ſolemn examination of our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Set the rule before thy Conſcience in its ſpiritual power, purity, and in the ſeveral parts of it. On this ſhe is to reflect, and by this ſhe muſt be regulated. 'Tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that you have them lying in habit with the ſuntereſis, but they ſhould be now actually educed and brought forth to view. For in that you are now to ſearch your ſelves by them, you muſt take an actual ſurveigh of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135216:35"/>them. <hi>David</hi> therefore did not ſatisfie himſelf that the laws of God were ever with him, but he did expoſe and lay them before him. <hi>Thy judgments have I laid before me,</hi> Pſal. 119.30. <hi>cum</hi> 98. And without this, the courſe you are now taking will be much-what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, and can never be fully commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with your deſign, this duty or Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, who bids you take heed to your ways according to his word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sift your Conſcience, and therewith your lives and actions, by the rules; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare her and them with this: Examine your ſelves, prove your own ſelves, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as men try metals, by bringing them to their proper meaſure, as Gold and Silver to the touch-ſtone, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Self-diſcuſſion by the divine ſtandard is of ſingular advantage, both for the diſcovery of your ſins, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> found it, and for the drawing out a diſcovery of your ſincerity, as <hi>Job. Pſ.</hi> 19.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8, 9, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 23.10, 11. Will you but caſt an eye on this glaſs, you ſhould ſee more of the nature and number of your ſins; the nature, neceſſity, and beauty of Gods ſervice, and continuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſhould contract his bleſſing on your ſelves, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.25. But in your ſolemn examinations, let me adviſe you to call forth the laws of God, and rules of godlineſs ſucceſſively and diſtinctly, and ſo to compare the ſeveral pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of your lives with them, both in the matter and manner of your actions. Hath the matter of my life born accord to this, that, and the other precepts? or hath there not been an attempt on, and violation of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135216:35"/>both this and that, and the other prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For the manner of my actions; have they been done upon that account, and with thoſe aimes, affections, &amp;c. that theſe rules preſcribe me, and whereupon they promiſe a bleſſing to me? By this courſe, Conſcience will be 1. Leſs complicated in her work, through the artifices of ſin or Satan. They uſually hide their deceits under the covert of generals. This unravels all the clue. 2. More compleat in her witneſs. For by this means many of thoſe actions, which lay out of ſight upon her records, are ſuggeſted by and to Conſcience afreſh. 3 More cogent in her witneſs; and it being more particular, it will be more prevalent with us; when Conſcience can now ſay to us, as <hi>Job</hi>'s friends to him, <hi>Lo this, I have ſearched it, ſo it is; hear then at, and know it for thy good,</hi> Job 5.27. 4, More conſtant in her witneſs, and more quick hence-forth and ready to her work. Her frequent conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with theſe rules and comparings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, form her unto a more habitual prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and preſent activity to cheriſh good, and check evil, while 'tis yet but in the egg and entrance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Stay thy Conſcience with the rule, and upon the reflections, which thou now makeſt. Let her not give a glance only, and ſo go off, but conſider, <hi>(Hebr.) Set your heart on your ways;</hi> as <hi>David, I conſidered;</hi> (Heb.) <hi>I thoughted my ways, Hag.</hi> 1.5, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. By this means, if conſideration be taken up in making ſuch compariſons, your work will thrive upon your hands, to a greater extenſion and a more
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:135216:36"/>gracious intenſion. Conſideration will fetch in the whole compaſs of Gods commands and our converſations. If Conſcience reflect upon an evil, this will rip it up in all its circumſtances, as it did in the Patriarchs and pious <hi>David;</hi> If upon a good this will run down its enquiry into the root and efficient of it, and then run it up again into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar and end of it, and ſo returns fraught with repentance on that hand, with rejoycing on this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21, 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. <hi>c.</hi> 2.17. 1.12. 'Tis neceſſary then that there ſhould be ſome immoration of our Conſcience, in an intent conſideration, when we are imployed in theſe ſelf-converſes. The worth hereof is great; the efficacy of ſuch reflections depending eminently thereupon. <hi>David</hi> thoughted his ways, and immediately turneth his feet to Gods word. The Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher conſiders, and is forthwith cured of his trouble and tentation. Whereas others through inconſiderateneſs run on in ſin, and ſome are held upon the rack of ſorrow and anguiſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.21, 22. Let me add a fourth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Shake off whatſoever will retard you in, or retain you from this work. Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will be ſuggeſting diſſwaſives and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Slothfulneſs will be ſticking at the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and diligence which muſt be uſed. The ſenſual and ſenſitive part will be ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and bogling at the diſpleaſingneſs and danger of it, as that which will hazard all her eaſe and ſelf-enjoyment. Yea, your ſelves
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:135216:36"/>will be but too ſhy of ſuch a duty, if you ſhake not off all ſuch inſinuations and ſuggeſtions, and ſet to it with all your might.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>3</label> Speak to thy Conſcience that ſhe will reflect more conſtantly, or at leaſt, that ſhe will reckon with thee in the cloſe of every day. (1) That ſhe reflect more conſtantly. <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>to have always a Conſcience void of offence,</hi> Act. 24.16. And elſewhere he ſpeaks of it in the preſent tenſe, (Not we had, or ſhall have, but) we have a good Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. And that is the good Conſcience which gives the quick reflex. It is true, I acknowledg, that your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are quick and ſudden in their motions; but Conſcience is as quick and ſudden, and though thoſe may have gotten the ſtart of her as <hi>Cuſhi</hi> did of <hi>Ahimaaz;</hi> yet ſhe can eaſily overtake and out-run them, as <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> did <hi>Cuſhi;</hi> becauſe ſhe runneth (as he did) by the way of the Plain. There are many more things to interrupt their motion, than hers. Truth is, 1. When an action is yet but in purpoſe, or in the propoſal, Conſcience ſhould reflect immediately (as ſhe is capacitated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly) to promote it, if good, as in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> or prevent it, if evil, as it did in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. 2. Or when an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is paſſing from the inward intention to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward execution, Conſcience ſhould catch it by the heel, in the place of the breaking forth of Children, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did his Brother; and as being Gods Centinel, ſhould require its paſs and certificate, and remand it back, if it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135216:37"/>it be bad, or reſcue it from its aſſailants, if it be good as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15,—24. 3. Or is an action paſt forth, without her animadvertence? ſhe ſhould forthwith pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it, and put the arreſt of her reflection upon it; and be asking what have I done; Or ask us, as <hi>Joab</hi> ask'd <hi>David, What haſt thou done?</hi> Jer. 8.6. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.24. To this end, labour for tenderneſs of Conſcience (of which hereafter) which will ſoon reflect upon the leaſt touch and preſſure, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.19. But alas! where is the Conſcience that hath not abuſed us, more or leſs, in all theſe? who can ſay my heart is clean? therefore urge her (2) To reckon with thee, at leaſt, in the cloſe of every day. Conſcience ſhould be ſtill every day, a doing with us; but there are two ſeaſons in the day, wherein we eſpecially ſhould have to do with Conſcience; <hi>viz.</hi> in the morning, that ſhe may tell us what we have to do this day; and in the evening, that ſhe tell us what we have done. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with your own heart upon your bed,</hi> Pſal. 4.4. 'Tis good communing with our ſelves, and ſpeaking to Conſcience, before we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves to ſleep. <hi>Job</hi> reflected every day upon the carriage of his Sons, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (no doubt) upon the carriage of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Thus did <hi>Job</hi> continually <hi>(Heb.)</hi> all the days, <hi>Job</hi> 1.5. This is the way to keep your accounts both more ſhort, and more ſure. Well, if conſcience be ſhy or ſullen, plead the cauſe with her as the very heathen could do

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135216:37"/>have I done, or elſe declined this day? or if ſhe return thee, that thy actions have been good for the matter; Return upon her yet again: Yea, but in what manner did I it? upon what motives? with what mind? in what method? &amp;c. So, what evil have I committed, or che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, or elſe given check to or crucified this day? or if this and that were not evil in it ſelf; have not I wounded it by ſome evil circumſtances? Believe it, Chriſtians, it would be of excellent advantage to your actual growth and eternal good, if you had ſuch a compendium of ſins and duties by you, or rather in you, as Conſcience might call it over every evening, and comparing your em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments that day with it, might be able to witneſs clearly your eſtate and actions of the day now paſt you.</p>

               <p>Q. 11. <hi>How manifold is Conſcience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The definition of Conſcience being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht, the diſtribution regularly follows to be next enquired into. Herein, I may not be too nice or acurate; but attending the deſign of a practical Caſuiſt, I ſhall accordingly guide my ſelf in the diſtribution hereof. Thus more generally (as both common experience, and clear Scripture evidence inſtruct us). There is (1) the good Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16, 21. (2) The evil Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. The good and evil conſcience may be conſidered and diſtributed, either (1) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtated habitude: Or (2) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeveral acts of mens Conſciences.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if we conſider the ſtate, or according to the ſtated habitude of mens Conſciences; ſo the Conſcience may be called good or evil, either (1) in an ethical and moral; Or (2) in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:135216:39"/>an Evangelical and Spiritual ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ethically good, or good upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon account; ſo is the Conſcience, which from a principle of moral righteouſneſs, is habitually diſpoſed toward, and actually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth its offices according to Ethical or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principles. In this ſenſe many Pagans had, and <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a good Conſcience, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.1. <hi>I have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all good Conſcience before God until this day: i.e.</hi> I have lived up to the light of my Conſcience: Or as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotators
<note n="*" place="margin">Ad locum</note>, <hi>I have ſerved God uprightly: i.e.</hi> without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, according to the knowledg I had.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Evangelically good, or good upon the Chriſtian account; ſo only is that Conſcience which from a ſpiritual principle of renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is habitually diſpoſed toward, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſchargeth its offices, according to evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical principles. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore incloſeth this, between charity out of a pure heart and faith unfeigned. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. Let me add, that the ſame Conſcience (as that of <hi>Paul</hi> before his effectual calling, and as is commonly found in Moral perſons which we may and do call good; <hi>ſenſu ethico,</hi> in an ethick ſenſe, we muſt call an evil Conſcience; <hi>ſenſu Evangelico</hi> in an Evangelical ſenſe. For ſo ſtill it is, an evil Conſcience, till it be purged from dead works by the blood of Chriſt, to ſerve the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, 10, 22.</p>
               <p>There is a double goodneſs found with the Conſcience, evangelically good; a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of purity, and a goodneſs of peace; or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135216:39"/>a goodneſs of ſincerity, and of ſecurity, (as a practical Writer of ours ſpeaketh

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. <hi>p.</hi> 26.</note>); Or a goodneſs of integrity, and of tranquillity; (as another

                     <hi>Dykes Good Conſ. p.</hi> 20. See <hi>Ameſ. de Conſc. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note>). Hence there is (1) the purified or pure Conſcience, inſtanced 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. And (2) the pacified or peaceable Conſcience, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. Oppoſite to this double goodneſs of Conſcience, there is a double evil of defilement to ſin, habitual and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and 2. of diſtreſs, to ſorrow and anguiſh of heart. Accordingly there is (1) the defiled Conſcience propounded, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. And (2) the diſquiet Conſcience pointed at, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.25.</p>
               <p>It muſt be herewith remembred; that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this twofold evil, nor that twofold good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do always co-exiſt in the ſame Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. There may be purity, yet no peace; and peace of Conſcience (ſuch as it is) yet no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. There may be an habitually, impure, or defiled Conſcience, which yet is not diſtreſſed; And there may be a diſtreſſed Conſcience which is not habitually impure or defiled; as will be ſeen in the further progreſs of this diſcourſe. Oh happy conjunction! when both goodneſſes, of peace, and of purity, of ſincerity and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, do meet in the fame Conſcience

               <p>Secondly, the good and evil Conſcience may be diſtributed according to the ſeveral acts of Conſcience: <hi>viz.</hi> Either 1. as it apprehends
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:135216:40"/>and dictates matters of law or right, where by it cometh to an iſſue in judgment. Or 2. as it applys and draws them down to the matter before it for judgment. Both which it doth either firmly and ſtrongly, or but feebly and weakly. Agreeable whereunto, there is (1) the weak and infirm Conſcience. And (2) the well-inabled, firm or ſtrong Conſcience. Of which ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7, 10, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1.</p>
               <p>As Conſcience (1) apprehends and dictates laws duly and aright, or defectively and amiſs. So far (as to this) Conſcience is either due, right and good. Here is the true Conſcience. Or 2. defective wrong and evil. Here is the falſe Conſcience; between which as partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating ſometimes of this, ſometimes of that extream, ſtands the 3d. probable Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If Conſcience dictates laws duly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, theſe laws it dictateth, are either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and drawn forth upon the mind within, and ſo are known by the light of natural reaſon. Or 2. imparted, by divine manifeſtation from without, and ſo are known only by a ſtar of greater magnitude, the light of ſupra-natural revelation. With accord to this there is (1) the natural Conſcience; and (2) the enlightned Conſcience. And we find the Apoſtle ſometimes appealing that, and ſometimes this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2, 3, 9, 15, 16, 19. <hi>Know ye not? &amp;c. i.e.</hi> Do not your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces tell ye as much?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Conſcience dictates laws defectively and amiſs, then it is either 1. through the darkneſs and ignorance thereof; or 2. through
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:135216:40"/>the deluſion and error, or through the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and heſitancy thereof. Agreeably, there is (1) the ignorant or blind Conſcience, as ſome phraſe it, though improperly enough; (2) and the erroneous Conſcience; (3) and the heſitating or doubtful Conſcience, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>cum</hi> 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.30, 31.</p>
               <p>But in that theſe doubts may be, and often are of various and different degrees, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the doubtful Conſcience may be, and is variouſly diſtinguiſhed: There is (1) the opining; (2) the ſcrupulous; and (3) the doubtful Conſcience, ſtrictly ſo called; which are (in brief) thus differenced. The doubtful Conſcience entertains not either part of the matter in queſtion before it; ſo as either to affirm, or deny it, but heſitates and hangs as it were between both. The ſcrupulous and opining Conſcience do both cloſe with one or other part; either affirming on the one hand, or denying on the other. The opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth this but feebly, the ſcrupulous doth it vexatiouſly. The ſcrupulous Conſcience is by this eminently differenced from the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that its cloſe with one part or other is ſtill conjoyn'd with ſome anxious ſuſpicion of, and ſollicitation to the other part.</p>
               <p>As Conſcience (2) applys and draws down matters of law to the matter of fact before it for judgment, either 1 aright, or 2 amiſs, well or ill; ſo the Conſcience (as to this) is either 1 aright and good; or 2 amiſs and bad. This application is not perfected, but in and by ſeveral acts; ſome whereof reſpect our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:135216:41"/>good, others our evil actions. According to theſe different acts, (of which <hi>Q.</hi> 7.) Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is by ſome diſtributed; and ſo there is the accuſing, the excuſing Conſcience, &amp;c. But this I purpoſly omit. And in that Conſcience is denominated either good or evil (as to this reſpect) according to its diſcharge of theſe acts and offices; I ſhall therefore diſtribute it rather with relation had 1 to the manner; 2. and to the meaſure of its diſcharge of theſe acts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conſider the manner; Conſcience proceeds in theſe acts and offices; either 1 en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and uprightly; or 2 hypocritically: Either 1 faithfully, or 2 unfaithfully: Either 1 inoffenſively, or 2. offenſively. And thus there is (1) the entire Heart or Conſcience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.72. And (2) the hypocritical, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.20. (1) The faithful Conſcience, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.9. (2) And the unfaithful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.9. (1) The inoffenſive Conſcience, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. (2) And the offenſive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7, 10. Hereof the firſt in each pair is an evil Conſcience; the ſecond in each pair, is a good Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As concerns the meaſure of this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; theſe acts are either, 1 by and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the juſt ſtandard, and ſo far the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whoſe acts theſe are, is good. Or 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the juſt ſtandard, and meaſure in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Or 3. above and beyond it in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; And ſo far the Conſcience, that thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys, is bad.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the former extream in the defect there is a double vice of Conſcience.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:135216:41"/>There is 1 the ſluggiſhneſs and oſcitancy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which reſpects principally the imployment of Conſcience. 2. The ſenſeleſneſs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duracy thereof, which reſpects (principally) the impreſſions on Conſcience; Oppoſite to the former, is the ſedulity of Conſcience, in its tranſactions and operations; Oppoſite to the latter, is the ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of Conſcience, with reſpect to its object. So that here are 1 the ſluggiſh Conſcience, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25. And 2 the ſenſeleſs Conſcience, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18, 19. on the one hand, which are evil: And the 1 ſtirring Conſcience, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.21. And 2 the ſoft or tender Conſcience, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.27. on the other hand, which are good.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add, that as with reſpect to the former vices, which are of different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the evil Conſcience may be diſtinguiſhed into that which 1 is ſleepy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. 2. and that which is ſtupified, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. 3. and that which is ſeared, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. So, with reſpect to the latter virtues, the good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be alſo differently diſtinguiſhed, according to thoſe different degrees. And ſo there is 1 the awakened Conſcience, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. 2 the attentive Conſcience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46. 3 The attrite or eminently tender Conſcience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the latter extream in the exceſs, there is a twofold evil of Conſcience: 1. There is the dread and terrors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, flying and declining Gods preſence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. 2 There is the deſpair and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Conſcience, accompanied with a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135216:42"/>looking for of puniſhment and judgment <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.3, 4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27. So that there is 1 the diſtracting and troubled Conſcience <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.13. 2 The deſpairing and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſcience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13, 14. Oppoſite here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, there is a twofold good of Conſcience. There is 1 the acquieſcence and reſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. 2 The aſſurance and rejoycing of Conſcience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably whereunto there is 1 the appeaſed and quiet Conſcience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7. 2 The aſſured and comforted Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.15.</p>
               <p>Theſe things will require and receive a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Q. 1. <hi>Whether we are to look upon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences as ſuch that are by nature evil?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THat we may prevent miſtakes, ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions muſt be premiſed of this term <hi>by nature:</hi> It may be and ſometimes is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood for, 1. That which is by and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtitution of Mans nature; as when we ſay, Man doth by nature conſiſt of a true body, and a reaſonable ſoul. Thus whatſoever is a principle or part of Mans nature is ſaid to be natural to him. 2. For that which is by and according to a conſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or emanation from Mans nature. As when we ſay, Man is by nature endowed with an Underſtanding, Will, &amp;c. Thus the powers and properties of Mans nature are ſaid to be natural to him. 3. Or for that which is by and according to a connexion with Mans nature; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We were by nature chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.3. This condition was connexed with our nature; we were ſubject to the revenging juſtice of God, as ſoon as we received the nature of man. Thus the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:135216:43"/>pravity and pollution of Mans nature, is ſaid to be natural to him.</p>
               <p>The import of this queſtion is not, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Conſcience be evil either in regard of its natural conſtitution or eſſence: In this ſenſe it muſt needs be good; becauſe it is by the ſpecial efficience and gift of God, <hi>Job</hi> 32.8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.7. Or 2. in regard of any natural conſecution or emanation from its nature. Thus it cannot be bad, but good, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; becauſe it cometh from the bleſſed God. whoſe work is perfect, <hi>Deut,</hi> 32.4. But 3. in regard of a natural connexion: <hi>i.e.</hi> Whether Conſcience in man, by and according to the condition which is connexed with his nature, be morally evil or ſinful, yea or no?</p>
               <p>That every mans Conſcience is by nature ſinful (in the ſenſe laſt mentioned) appears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the notorious defilement of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man by nature. Theſe propoſitions are of Apoſtolical proof, <hi>That all have ſinned; and that they are all under ſin: That all the world is become guilty before God: And that they are all by nature children of wrath,</hi> Rom. 3.9, 19, 23. Epheſ. 2.3. <hi>What is man that he ſhould be clean? and that which is born of a woman that he ſhould be righteous?</hi> ſaith <hi>Eliphaz. All per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and all the parts of man are impure and defiled,</hi> Job 15.14, 15, 16. Rom. 3.9—19. <hi>And who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? To them that are defiled is nothing pure: but even their mind and conſcience is defiled, Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. The leaven of ſin hath over-ſpread the whole lump. The leproſie of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:135216:43"/>ſin hath left no faculty untainted. The whole head is ſick, and the whole heart faint. It reacheth from the crown of the head to the ſole of the foot: So that the Conſcience is corrupt as well as the corporeal part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the notable declarations in the Covenant of Grace. What on Gods part is therein more clearly propoſed than this? <hi>I will put a new ſpirit within you; I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh. I will circumciſe your hearts; I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 11.19, 20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 36.26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. And what can on mans part then be more clearly ſuppoſed than this? That the heart of man is of a ſtony, adamantine and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed temper; without the ſculpture of any ſaving truth, e're grace takes him within the Covenant. And ſurely by nature, the ſons of men are all ſtrangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.26, 27. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>cum</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the known deſign of the Commandments and conveyance of Grace: A good Conſcience is the end of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience were good by nature, how ſhould the goodneſs thereof be the end and effect of the Goſpel of Grace? A good Conſcience was not found by the Goſpel, in the regions where it came, but was the fruit of the Goſpel. The Goſpel was ſent amongſt them, not as ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:135216:44"/>their Conſcience already good; but to ſet them right. and leave them good whom it found bad, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. A good Conſcience is the effect of the grace of faith in Chriſt; God purifying mens hearts by faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. Before the coming of faith then, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is defiled; <hi>To the unbeliever nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> pure.</hi> And manifeſt enough it is, that faith it Chriſt never grew in the garden of nature, when moſt pure from the weeds of ſin, which the Fall hath brought in; but is an eflux of divine grace, and an eſpecial gift of God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> From the neceſſary diffuſion of ſanctifying grace throughout the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man; <hi>The God of peace ſanctifie you wholly:</hi> the whole then was ſinful. <hi>And I pray God your whole ſpirit, and ſoul and body, be preſerved blameleſs, &amp;c.</hi> The upper region of Mans ſoul then, and which is rational; as well as the lower region, and which is more ſenſitive were ſtained and culpable. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience therefore cannot but be corrupted, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. The Conſcience could neither require nor receive the renovation of grace, if it were righteous by nature: But reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation paſſeth through all the parts and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers; <hi>Behold all things are become new.</hi> This is to put on the new man, and to put off the old man. Sin did, and Sanctification now doth extend it ſelf over all the man, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the mind. To be renewed is eminently in the ſpirit of our mind, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:135216:44"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> From the noted derivation of a good Conſcience to us, by means of Chriſt: Till his blood be ſprinkled on us, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not ſanctified in us, as is implied <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. 'Tis the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, which purgeth your Conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Hebr. 9.14. Conſcience is impure then, till Chriſt purgeth it: 'Tis he freeth it from ſin, and fitteth it for Gods ſervice. But by nature we are all without Chriſt; alienated and enemies in our minds by wicked works. Men do not come by nature, but are called by grace unto the fellowſhip of the Son Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>cum</hi> 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> From the notable defilement of Conſcience in the diſcharge of its acts and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now <hi>laeſae actiones laeſas facultates indicant.</hi> It muſt needs be a maimed and diſeaſed power, that puts forth ſuch maimed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed performances. Theſe I ſhall briefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the next Queſtion, and judg needful, to pluck down the pride of Man, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you from the dangerous precipices of many, who cry up Conſcience, and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct for Salvation, inſtead of calling men to Chriſt, and to the conduct of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:135216:45"/>Q. 2. <hi>What are the evils of Mans Conſcience naturally, which we ſhould be heedful of, and and humbled under?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though I cannot fully open that ſink of ſin, which lieth here, (a work that is more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately done by an acute and able hand

               <p>Conſcience may be conſidered, either as it is to conſerve and ark up laws and rules of practice, or as it is to come and apply theſe laws and rules. 'Tis miſerably corrupt in both. How far it falls ſhort as to the former, will be of particular diſcuſſion hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of the natural Conſcience; Oh how it is darkned, depraved, diſabled! as concerns the matter of an holy life in this world, and the means of an happy life in the world to come. How are men alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart! <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14.</p>
               <p>The main concernment of Conſcience is to apply rules of practice. And here how deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably corrupt it is. (1) Sometimes it doth not apply at all. How many practical notions are ſwimming in the head, that never ſink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart, and the heart is never ſet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of or concoct them into practice! How
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:135216:45"/>much ſcience and confidence find we in theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.19.—23. but no Conſcience; large and ſound apprehenſions; but little or no ſelf-application. 1. The evil of Conſcience is as to this ſo eminent, that a general command is not thought enough by God; but it muſt be particular and expreſſive, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods, &amp;c. Thou ſhalt not covet, &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 20.3.—18. The parable, as pertinent as it was to <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, never pinched <hi>Davids</hi> Conſcience; the Prophet himſelf was fain to do the office of <hi>Davids</hi> Conſcience for him: <hi>And Nathan ſaid to David, Thou art the man, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.1.—14. 2.

               <p n="1">1. How little doth it attend! inſomuch as God complains, <hi>None ſaith, reſtore;</hi> and calls out, <hi>Who will hearken and hear for the time to come? Iſa.</hi> 42.23. How few are there that (with <hi>Mary</hi>) ponder thoſe things in their hearts, which concern the after-times and their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal peace. But how many that hold faſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that refuſe to return, and ſet their heart on their iniquity, rather than to ſeek out their duty: <hi>And becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil,</hi> Luk. 2.19. Jer. 8.5. Chap. 5.3. Hoſ. 4.8. Eccleſ. 8.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How loſt is its authority! Conſcience hath much-what left its ſubordination to God and his word: <hi>Lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wiſdom is in them,</hi> Jer. 8.9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.10. The Commandments of Men are received, and the Commandments of God are rejected by the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and Conſcience is pretended and pleaded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.1.—10. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.1.—14. Conſcience hath much what loſt alſo its ſuperiority over the Will and Affections, which it ſhould over-rule and order. God calls, and Conſcience calls, <hi>Return ye every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.</hi> And they ſaid, <hi>There is no hope; but we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:135216:48"/>will walk aſter our own devices, and we will do every one the imagination of his evil heart.</hi> And ſo Conſcience is often enſlaved, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wholly extinguiſhed by corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.11, 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. How low is its aſpect! Conſcience ſhould order every buſineſs to be done; as for and as before God; and ſhould hold back from ſin, as that which diſpleaſeth, diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oureth, and is contrary to God. But alas! how far diſtant are mens counſels! which abundantly ſpeak the defilement of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Ahab</hi> humbleth himſelf, but 'tis to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the ſufferings denounced from God, not in abhorrence of the ſin done againſt God. <hi>Jehu</hi> reforms, but 'tis to enſure the Government, not to exalt Godlineſs. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence calls the <hi>Phariſees</hi> to prayer and almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds; but 'tis to be ſeen of men, rather than ſerve God. (Calls the People and the Prieſts to faſting at ſome times, to feaſting at others) But keeps them within themſelves, carrieth them not up to God, as their end, in either, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.21, <hi>ad finem.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.28. <hi>cum.</hi> 31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p n="4">4. How languid are its acts! Conſcience is 1. to inform and dictate what we are to do, what to decline; but this it doth many times falſly, moſt times ineffectually, calling evil good, and good evil; putting darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs: Or if it preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth our duty right, yet not ſo as to prevail to the doing thereof regularly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:135216:49"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. 2. Conſcience is to engage and bind us from iniquity to duty. But this it doth, either very feebly, or forbears and lets fall its bonds; in an affliction happily theſe bonds ſeem faſt and firm; but the heart is not right with God, nor remains ſtedfaſt with him, and they ſoon fall of again. And as for the word ſpoken to them in the name of the Lord (when the rod is over, they are ready to ſay), <hi>We will not hearken to thee, but we will certainly do whatſoever ſeems good in our own eyes, &amp;c.</hi> Hoſ. 5.15. chap. 4.6. Pſ. 78.34, 37. Jer. 44.16, 17. 3. Conſcience is to impell and inſtigate: but alas! how faintly doth it this, or elſe forbears it! inſomuch as the Prophet complains, <hi>There is none that ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up himſelf to take hold of thee,</hi> Iſa. 64.7. And the beſt of Believers have ſound frequent cauſe of awakening and alaruming their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.8. <hi>chap.</hi> 103.1, 2. 4. Yea, Conſcience is ready to engage againſt all this; ſo corrupt it is as to be angry with the ſtrict and ſearching Truths of God; and with <hi>Ahab</hi> to quarel with Gods <hi>Elijahs, Haſt thou found me, O mine enemy?</hi> And to conclude with him againſt the meſſengers of God, as he touching <hi>Micajah, He never propheſieth good concerning me, but evil:</hi> Yea, to hate the good, and love the evil; to hate him that rebuketh in the gate; to hate the light, and will not come to the light leſt his deeds ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.20. <hi>ch.</hi> 22.8. <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19, 20.</p>
               <p>How extream then is the evil of Conſcience

               <p>The cure of the ſeveral evils or ſickneſſes of Conſcience, as alſo the cure of the ſeveral ſorts of an evil Conſcience muſt be expected by you, and will be endeavoured by me, more particularly hereafter.

See (1) Thou do not ſtifle or ſuppreſs them: <hi>They held the truth down in unrighteouſneſs, and liked not to retain God in their knowledg,</hi> Rom. 1.

(2) Thou do not ſit down or ſit ſtill under them. Is Conſcience convinced, how canſt thou be quiet? Are theſe chains to ſleep in? What! condemned of thy ſelf, and yet ſit quiet? What if God ſhould condemn thee too! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we ſhould hear thee crying out with the Jaylor and thoſe Jews, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?

(3) See thou do not ſhift them off: They were convicted by their own Conſcience, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 8.) but it came to no good, they ſtealing away from Chriſt, and ſhifting away from Conſcience, every one to his courſe of life. <hi>Cain</hi> baffles Conſcience with build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cities, and a crowd of ſecular buſineſſes. <hi>Saul</hi> is melancholy (happily Convictions might be upon him from the Lord, though this was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135216:50"/>not all), and he muſt have the Miniſtrel, the muſick, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.15, 17. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.23. See thou be not diverted from thy Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by any company, eſpecially which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; or by any ſecular contrivance; and that thou do not diſmiſs them, as <hi>Felix</hi> did his, till another convenience, whoſe Conſcience as far as appears did ever after contract more guilt and filthineſs, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25, 26, 27.

               <p n="2">II. Speak to Conſcience,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> and ſuffer that to ſpeak to unto you; commune often with it, and ask it, What have I done? and (as the Lord asked <hi>Cain</hi>) <hi>What haſt thou done?</hi> As ever you would have Conſcience throughly ſalved, you muſt throughly ſearch; let your probe go to the bottom of its ulcerated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; let thy ſpirit make diligent ſearch, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6. Having ſearched it, ſpeak to it; tell it of its ſick, ſad, perilous and pitiful eſtate; tell it of its rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Gods revenging juſtice.

The knowledg of your caſe is a fair ſtep towards your cure. Do not ſilence or ſuſpend Conſcience, or ſhut its mouth, or thy ears, againſt its clamors. Conſcience calls to you, as <hi>Jotham</hi> to the men of <hi>Shechem,</hi> Hearken unto me that God may hearken unto you; and if you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, be ſure the end will be full of hazard: Wrath is like to come upon you to the uttermoſt, who charge Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſometimes did the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, <hi>That they teach no more in this Name:</hi> Or are ready to chide Conſcience as <hi>Amaziah</hi> ſometime quipped the Prophets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, <hi>Art thou made of the Kings counſel? forbear, why ſhouldſt thou be ſmitten?</hi> Judg. 9. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.18. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 25.16, 17.</p>

Hearken then, Oh care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſinner, and conſider; (1) If Conſcience

Can the ſalt-ſpring yield freſh ſtreams, or will the ſharp thorn bring forth ſweet grapes? <hi>Every tree</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>is known by his own fruit: For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble-buſh gather they grapes.</hi> He applies it to the caſe in hand, <hi>An evil man out of the evil treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth evil things.</hi> Let Conſcience be evil, and thy Converſation, thy Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not like to be good. For theſe things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and they defile the man. And this know, though thy converſation be bad, thy Conſcience is worſe.

(2) Is Conſcience evil? your callings are evil; though not in themſelves, yet to your ſelves. If this be depraved, there is nothing pure to you; your tables become a ſnare, and your trading becomes a ſin.

(3) Is Conſcience evil, your comforts are evil? Inward comforts are but enſnaring cheats, and the illuſions and couſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges of the evil one.

               <p n="1">(1) The Principal is God: <hi>Every good and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the father of Lights.</hi> The good Conſcience is from the God of Conſcience: The God that made thy Conſcience can alone make thy Conſcience good: <hi>Acknowledg him then in all thy ways, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi> Ask of him by prayer and ſtrong crys, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Thou art good, and doſt good, teach me thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes: Incline my heart to thy Teſtimonies: Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes: Create in me a clean heart, O God:</hi> Jam. 1.17.

It proceedeth from the good-will of the Father: The Inſpiration of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty giveth Underſtanding: 'Tis He that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Wiſdom in the inward parts, and giveth Underſtanding to the Heart.

It is procured by the great worth of the Son, who was made ſin for us, to take ſin from us; and in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinful fleſh, by a ſacrifice for ſin, hath condemned ſin in the fleſh, and ſo brings us to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>marg.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.

Purſue thy petitions upon the price he hath paid. 3. It is produced by the gracious work of the Spirit. If Conſcience be ſpiritual and gracious it comes from the ſpirit of Grace; if pure, if holy, 'tis by the power of the Holy Ghoſt: 'Tis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal till the Spirit comes; never ſpiritual till born of the Spirit: <hi>It is the ſpirit of life which ſets it free from the law of ſin and death: Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. What

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are ſome things to be done:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> If you would enſure the cuſtody of a good Conſcience,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Employ your ſtricteſt care:</hi> Sin and Satan lay their main Batteries againſt this; the good Conſcience is the grand Citadel of a gracious Chriſtian; get this, and they get all; keep this and ye keep all. You are proportionably concerned to preſerve the outer guards in your Converſations; but you are principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to preſerve the inner and main guard of your Conſcience: Keep this and it will keep thee: But remember as it was not gotten idly, ſo neither is it kept but with induſtry: Keep thy heart with diligence, nay with all diligence, and above all keeping; and good reaſon, <hi>for out of it are the iſſues of life,</hi> Prov. 2.10, 11. <hi>c.</hi> 4.20, 21, 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Extend this care to all the ſorts and kinds of a good Conſcience:</hi> To the pure, peaceable, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ſoft and tender Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we ſhall inſtruct hereafter, yea and to the whole circuit and compaſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Take a proſpect of every part, in every propoſition that it may be good, both as a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:135216:80"/>Rule, and as a Witneſs, and as a Judg: Of which alſo you may expect in the enſuing parts of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hear Conſcience:</hi> Conſcience hath a voice within you, as well as Chriſt in his Word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you; a voice * of correction in caſe of evil; <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, &amp;c? Pſal.</hi> 43.5. A voice of counſel and direction, for continuance and growth in good, as <hi>David</hi>'s had, <hi>My reins alſo inſtruct me in the night-ſeaſon,</hi> Pſal. 16.7. <hi>Hear counſel then, and receive inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that thou mayſt be wiſe in the latter end.</hi> Conſcience never hardens till it is not heard; the more attention is given by you, the more authority is gained to it, and the better adviſe it giveth to you. Attend the directions and diſcourſe of Conſcience then, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, who thereby kept an unſpotted Conſcience, amidſt all aſperſions and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.20. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.11.</p>

The Word muſt be the <hi>Regula regulans;</hi> Conſcience is but <hi>Regula regulata;</hi> Conſcience muſt take the rule from Chriſt in his Word, and then give it to the Chriſtian, for the weighing of his Eſtate and Actions: The Word is the lamp for the feet, and light for the paths, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Engage the choice and conſtant reſolutions of your wills:</hi> It is well with Conſcience while the Will is conſtant, and cleaves unto God with full purpoſe; let the Will be preſerved ſteady, and its welfare will be preſerved in ſafety: The weal of Conſcience much-what follows the Will's choice, and when this is found divided, that is faulty and diſeaſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.2.

               </p>
               <p>THere is a double purity of the Conſcience; 1. Exact and legal, as fully anſwers to what the Law asks: 2. Evangelical and more large, as fitly agrees with what the Goſpel allows: That excludes all degrees of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and includes all degrees of perfection; this allows no degree of pollution, and aſpires after the higheſt degree of perfection.</p>

Who was ever poſſeſſed in this life with the perfection of Conſcience? Conſcience is never perfected till the Chriſtian is perfected, and the body of ſin, and this ſinful body be put off fully, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10, <hi>&amp;c. Phil.</hi> 3.12, <hi>&amp;c. What is man that he ſhould be clean?</hi> His Conſcience is miſerably polluted and ſeared, who durſt pretend to perfection in the ſight of God, and wretchedly deceiveth himſelf, and denieth the Scriptures of God, <hi>Job</hi> 15.14, 15, 16. <hi>c.</hi> 25.4, 5, 6. <hi>c.</hi> 11.4, 5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 8, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly.

(2) The noted power of this Conſcience: The pure Conſcience hath a power of converting even the baſeſt Mettals like the Philoſopher's Stone, into pure Gold; afflictions into advantages: To the pure Conſcience all things are pure; like that Perfume which the Lord preſcribeth <hi>Moſes,</hi> whatever they are aſunder, being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered together they are pure and holy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19, <hi>&amp;c.

Yea, in the very Society of the Saints, be yet ſtill upon thy Watch, looking diligently. One defection hath defiled many; and the more weak thou art, the more watchful be thou. A weak Conſcience is defiled quickly: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. (2) Watch againſt Satan.

And you muſt lay aſide all filthineſs, if you would be free; not only groſſer ſins which put out Conſcience; their ſpot is not the ſpot of his Children: But leſſer ſins, which pollute Conſcience, though not ſo eminently, as greater do.

               <p>Peace of Conſcience (if we underſtand it ſtrictly) imports more than an immunity
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:135216:98"/>from inward Concertations and Concuſſions; it implieth alſo an enjoyment of it ſelf, with a victorious ſerenity in the felicitating ſmiles of God's Countenance, and in viewing the ſpoils of Sin and Satan, its vanquiſhed adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27.

Peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being originally but the reflex of this, that God is reconciled and at peace with us: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>Job</hi> 22.21.

But the impure Conſcience hath no intereſt in Chriſt; he is not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, but at war and enmity with Chriſt: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>Fph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. 3.

Though you reſt in a ſtate of ſin and corruption; for ſo had <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion; Conſcience was quiet and cheery till the Commandment came; ſo had the young man, ere he converſeth with Chriſt; Conſcience doth not trouble him, ere Chriſt talketh with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.22. 2.

Yea unto, and in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval by death, in the very laſt congreſs with the King of Terrours: <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe;</hi> ſaith the rich man, even to the very night that his Soul was required of him. <hi>Job</hi> tells you,

                  <hi>that the houſes of the wicked are of times ſafe</hi> (Heb. <hi>peace) from fear. They ſpend their days in wealth or mirth, and in a moment go down to the Grave.

Peace of Conſcience is no mark of a pious Chriſtian ſingly and of it ſelf; nor do we find it ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply inſiſted upon by them as ſuch. I never find any Saint in the whole Scripture pleading it as the ſignal evidence, much leſs as the ſole evidence of his juſtification and change from death to life. When they would clear their being in and bleſſedneſs by Chriſt, they do not attempt the proof of it by their peaceable and quiet enjoyments of themſelves, or of him, but by their pious intercourſe with and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to him, in the crucifying of their ſins, and quickning of their Souls: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3, <hi>&amp;c. c.</hi> 3.19, <hi>&amp;c.

A polluted Conſcience may enjoy more peace, (ſuch as it is) than doth many a pure Conſcience. What taſts have many ſuch of the Heavenly gift, and of the good Word of God; yea, and of the Powers of the World to come, who yet have not arrived to the things that accompany Salvation? Whereas, others are chaſtened every morning, have ſorrow in their heart daily: For peace have great bitterneſs, and are afflicted from their youth up: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>cum</hi> 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.14. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15.</p>

Rom. 14.17. Jam. 3.17. Remember 1. It is purity of Conſcience is the principle of peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I mean of ſound and ſaving peace. This excellent reſt is the effect of righteouſneſs; Peace followeth Grace in all the Apoſtolical Salutations, and floweth from it; <hi>To be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually-minded is life and peace: Iſa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. <hi>c.</hi> 8.6. 2. Peace is but a priviledg, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable priviledg of purity and grace: So that it is neither proper nor prudent to prove grace by peace. Into what a labyrinth of perplexing and amazing fears may you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve your ſelves, while you limit your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and proceed by peace! Eſpecially, there being ſo many evidences of much grace, where there was no peace, in <hi>Job, David, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and others. 3. Your peace will never prove your purity, ſimply and by it ſelf. There is that nearneſs and ſimilitude between the falſe and ſophiſticated peace of ſinners, on the one hand, and the ſound and ſaving peace of Saints on the other hand, if they are materially conſidered. Doth this Saint feel no ſting of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? neither doth that Sinner. Hath this Saint ſuavities of Conſcience? ſo that Sinner. You muſt proceed further therefore in your Enquiries. Doth my peace reſult from the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:135216:101"/>enjoyment of my ſelf in the God of Peace, as my ſupream end and ſoveraign good? from the enervating of Sin and Satan, the grand ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Peace, which war againſt my Soul? From the entire ſubjection of my whole Man to the Prince of Peace, in my quiet and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful compliance with his Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things prove indeed the truth of your Peace; but they take in Grace with it, and are but an intermediate proof of your Peace; <hi>viz.</hi> as they are the immediate effects and evidence of your Grace. 4. Prove your Purity, and it will prove your Peace then. If the Lord Jeſus be a King of Righteouſneſs to you, he will be after that a King of Peace alſo: <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2. But truth is, peace of Conſcience without purity is both defiling; <hi>

He bears off commotions, whatſoever may diſturb the quiet and peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which he uſeth as his Quarters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. If a ſpark of Conviction be let fall in a ſickneſs, or ſome other ſtrait, he hath his earth to ſmother and ſtifle it, or his water to cool and quench it.

He bribes the Conſcience if it be at any time clamorous, or is prone to quarrel. Sometimes with the divertiſements of ſinful or ſenſual pleaſures, that the noiſe of theſe may out-voice, and their muſick charm the Conſcience. Sometimes with the devotions of a ſtricter profeſſion. The drunken rounds and debaucheries of riot will no longer quiet, but rather cut and wound the Conſcience. He is content that <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> ſhall change their company and work too, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, ſo they cleave to him as their Maſter. He knoweth how to put on the appearance of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:135216:103"/>an Angel of Light. Sometimes by the delicious ſweets of a promiſe, which he either halves, or otherwiſe abuſeth. The heart, happily, is at no peace, for lack of a promiſe. The babe muſt have the breaſt. Satan, who ever attends his advantage, can transform himſelf into a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of righteouſneſs; and draws out the breaſt of the Promiſe, as he did unto Chriſt; <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee.</hi> But he omits the principal part of it, and with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of overthrowing him by the ſecurity of the Promiſe, when he could not overcome by the ſword and ſpear of his power: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2, 3. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14, 15. <hi>c.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.6. <hi>cum Pſal.</hi> 91.11. Well then, beware of Satan; you have ſeen his arts, be not enſnared by them. Be not ignorant of his devices.

Others it may be will be ſoothing you up in a falſe peace, though you walk in the imagination of your own hearts, amongſt fire-balls and deaths; and will be promiſing you life, while you perſiſt in your luſts.

They skin over the ſores of their fond and fooliſh Patients, without ſearching or probing them, or drawing out the putrid matter and core which is at the bottom of them; that addeth to their peril, and will augment their future pain. They are healing their Souls, while they ſhould be hewing at their ſins, and laying the ax at the very root. For this God will ſurely and ſeverely viſit: <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>c.</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.5, 9. Take heed then, and turn thine ear, eſpecially thy heart from all ſuch; for they ſpeak a Viſion of their own heart.

But be it remembred alſo, that he giveth not up any judicially, who give not up themſelves actually and voluntarily.

(2) From its ſenſuality and enſlavedneſs to the ſenſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and thoſe ſecular objects which it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. When the brutiſh appetite, through mens lazineſs or liſtleſneſs, once ſupercedes and commands the rational, a cheap liberty will content the Conſcience, which now lies captivated in its chains. Now God's judgments are far above out of his ſight. And while ſenſe and fancy have their fill, Conſcience is eaſily flattered, and he ſaith in his heart, <hi>I ſhall never be moved.</hi> Soul take thine eaſe, ſaith he. Why ſhouldſt thou feed upon gall and hemlock, who haſt goods laid up for many years? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.5, 6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19.

Whence it is, that the commands are ſo much iterated and ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated for examining our ſelves, conſidering our ways. <hi>&amp;c. Jer.</hi> 5.24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.5, 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. (4) From its ſleepineſs and inanimadvertency. Happily the notion and neceſſity of ſelf-examining ſticks upon men, after a Sermen, or in a Sickneſs. But 'tis not ſo powerfully and prevailingly, as to put them

And God hearkens and hears, and there is not ſo much as a queſtion put to their hearts. Well, happily he renews his calls, and repeats his knocks by ſome ſmarter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or ſeverer preaching; and yet through a ſleepy deadneſs, Conſcience is prone to reply as he did in the Goſpel, <hi>Trouble me not, the door is now ſhut, and my children are in bed with me, I cannot yet riſe and give thee:</hi> Eph. 5.14. Jer. 8.6. Luk. 11.7. (5) From its ſeared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inſenſibleneſs, whereby the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woes and alarums of wrath, which are ſounded in his word, and reſounded in his works, make no impreſſion upon it, or upon the affections. A ſmall prick is ſoon ſenſed by a ſound part; but pierce, preſs, cut, knock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a ſeared part, and there is no ſenſe of pain. This Conſcience is ſeared, as with an hot iron, it is paſt feeling. Let the two-edged Sword be bathing it ſelf in blood and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; let it be dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit; and diſſecting even to the joints and marrow of him, that ſits with him in the ſame ſeat; yet this ſeared Conſcience neither feels nor fears it. Nay though his own doings have beſet him round about, he will neither ſay to his heart, nor ſuffer his heart to ſpeak to him, in what an eſtate he ſtandeth: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. (6) From its ſtubbornneſs and indurateneſs; whereby
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:135216:105"/>it will not be beaten out, nor brought off, its old cuſtomary pretenſions for peace, and quiet ſelf-poſſeſſion. Could we flaſh in ſome of the eternal flames, and open the horrors of Death and Hell; yet through the power of ſuch pre-poſſeſſions of his own Salvation, like the Horſe (in <hi>Job), he goeth on to meet the armed men, he mocketh at fear, and is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, neither turneth he his back from the ſword, &amp;c.</hi> And is ready to ſay with thoſe (in <hi>Iſaiah), We have made a Covenant with death, and with hell are we at an agreement.</hi> He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth God hath curſed ſuch ſins; yet bleſſeth himſelf in his own heart: <hi>Job</hi> 39.21, 22. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The vicious carriage of Conſcience, in, and upon the trial of our eſtates, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal fountain of this falſe Peace. None of the Cauſes without the Conſcience can prejudice you, unleſs there be a part-taking by Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within you. In vain doth Satan force, or his Diſciples flatter, till Conſcience falls in with them, and ſpeaks that falſe peace, to which theſe ſeduce you. And therefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures reſolve it into this, as the next cauſe; If he bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, <hi>I ſhall have peace.</hi> When they ſhall ſay, <hi>Peace, peace: Deut.</hi> 29.19. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3.

                  </gap>, <hi>Deceiving their own ſelves.</hi> It puts a fallacious argument, or paralogiſm up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Conſcience always comes to a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:135216:106"/>on of our eſtate, and ſo of our peace, (as you have ſeen already) by ſome practical Syllogiſm. If our peace be falſe, its procedure is fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in one part ſtill, or other of this practical Syllogiſm, wherein it doth impoſe upon us, or is impoſed upon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes it is out in the Propoſition, as it taketh and tendereth us, a falſe mark or rule to try our eſtates by. Thus were they deceived, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.26, 27. The aſſumption was true (and in this they atteſt God himſelf), <hi>Lord, Lord, we have propheſied in thy name; we have eat and drunk in thy preſence; we have been hearers of thy Word, &amp;c.</hi> But the Propoſition was falſe, (which is therewith included), All thoſe that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy name, have eat and drunk in thy preſence, have been hearers of thy Word, ſhall be ſaved and eternally happy. This was a falſe Propoſition; and hereby they fell into that falſe peace, concluding themſelves in a ſaving condition, from an unſound and falſe <hi>medium,</hi> which could not bear the weight of ſuch a Concluſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes it is out in the Aſſumption, as it tenders a falſe teſtimony or report, of what we are and do in the trial of our eſtates. Thus were they deceived, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.35. <hi>Becauſe</hi> I <hi>am innocent, ſurely his anger ſhall turn from me.</hi> The Propoſition implied was true, <hi>[viz. Gods anger ſhall turn away from all ſuch as are innocent.]</hi> But the Aſſumption, <hi>viz. [I am inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,]</hi> was falſe. <hi>Behold, I will plead with thee, ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou ſayeſt, I have not ſinned,</hi> ibid. &amp; v. 23, <hi>&amp;c. How canſt thou
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:135216:106"/>ſay, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim: See thy way in the Valley, know what thou haſt done, &amp;c.</hi> Thus, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. faith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> Conſcience in giving ſuch falſe evidence doth but put a cheat upon us, a lie upon God (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) and proclaims us aliens from the truth of Grace, and of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes Conſcience is out in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Sometimes (1) Men ſuſpend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, as did thoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit ſuch things are worthy of death, not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence dealt fairly with them, as to the two firſt Propoſitions, [viz. <hi>They that do ſuch things are worthy of death; But we do ſuch things.</hi>] But as to the Concluſion how fallaciouſly! Not only hiding and with-holding the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or concluſion from them, that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly have followed upon thoſe premiſſes; But indulging them a ſinful Complacence in their Society, who did them. (2) Sometimes me ſhuffle in another, a falſe Concluſion, which the Premiſſes will not admit, and are alien from. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. <hi>And it cometh to paſs, when he heareth the words of this Curſe, that he bleſſeth himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt.</hi> Conſcience ſeems clear in the Propoſition, [There is no bleſſing but a curſe for them, that walk in their own luſts and imaginations.] And to confeſs
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:135216:107"/>the Aſſumption, [But I walk in the luſts and imagination of mine own heart.] Yet is it ſo far from concluding againſt his bleſſedneſs and peace, which ſhould be the genuine reſult from thoſe Premiſſes that ſhe concludeth for it, and foyſteth in another Concluſion in this Soul's caſe, [I ſhall have peace though I walk in theſe imaginations of mine heart.] How ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is it, that men thus ſhuffle and turn off the ſevere paſſages of Sermons and Scriptures from themſelves to the ſentence of others! when as ever they would avoid the Curſe, <hi>they ſhould lay it to their own hearts:</hi> Mal. 2.2. Sometimes (3) Men ſhift off the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that if Conſcience will not ſuſpend the true, nor ſhuffle in a falſe ſentence; yet ſhe muſt ſpeak it ſo ſoftly, and the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſo eaſie, as it may not ſtick nor abide upon them. Conſcience concludeth the <hi>Jews</hi> condition upon them, and quickeneth them to a return to him, that ſmote them. But the cogency thereof is ſoon off, there was no ſetled impreſſion. Their heart was not right with him. <hi>Neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: Pſal.</hi> 78.34,—38. Well then, as ever you would avoid the fearful precipices of a falſe peace, watch Conſcience in all its proceeds and parts; and in the diſcuſſion of thy eſtate, uſe thy utmoſt diligence, and moſt univerſal obſervance. Of which in the next Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. As touching the Propoſition, wherein Conſcience delivereth ſome truth, as a rule or mark to try your eſtate by. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe (1) That you try ſuch marks by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. 'Tis no imputation, either to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or prudence of a Magiſtrate, to try the ſeveral meaſures by the ſtandard of the Market. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> preached by an infallible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; yet the <hi>Berean</hi> providence of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Sermons to the teſt of Scriptures, ſearching the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo, is commended as noble and generous, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. Believe not every ſpirit, every ſign that is or may be ſuggeſted; but ſearch the Scriptures, as our Saviour beſpeaks thee, whether they be marks, and what marks (or of what) they ſo be: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39.</p>
               <p>Try whether it be a mark that Conſcience tenders thee for this trial. Is ſhe not raviſht with a ſtrange woman, and imbraceth the boſom of a ſtranger? Happily thou counteſt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:135216:108"/>thoſe things marks, which thou ſhouldſt rather call thy miſtakes. <hi>If a man think himſelf to be ſomething when he is nothing, he deceiveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Gal. 6.3. He may and ſhall deceive his own heart, that deduceth his arguments but from the ſemblances and appearances of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But he that argueth from the inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble properties of Religion, puts himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by beyond that peril of a ſelf-deception: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.26. Bring the ſign or mark then thou wouldſt try thy eſtate by, to the ſcales and touch-ſtone of the Scriptures. Preſs Conſcience to anſwer theſe three Queſtions. 1. Is this mark found upon all that are in the ſtate of Salvation? Becauſe the particular guiſes and affections of ſome individual perſons are found upon me, I cannot thence prove, that I am a Man; if I would cogently argue it, I muſt evince it from ſuch affections as are common to the whole kind. 'Tis as great an impotence and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight to conclude my peace and ſalvation, from communicating in the characters of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtians. My enquiries ſhould be rather after ſuch Characters as do agree to all that are indeed and throughout Chriſtians. They urge perhaps from the ſingular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſome ſaved ones, as if they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome ſignal evidence for Heaven, having arrived to that height, unto which but few did attain: <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name eaſt out Devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</hi> But our Saviour neither admits the plea, nor accepts the perſons, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. And teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:135216:108"/>us to fetch our Evidences, not from the ſingular priviledges of ſome numerical Saints, but from that ſpirit of obedience which runs through the veins of all Saints, and is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from any that are ſaved, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. The Propoſition had need be univerſal. As, <hi>Peace be to all them that are in Chriſt Jeſus. By him all that believe are juſtified. Whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 5.14. Act. 13.39. Joh. 3.15, 16. 2. Is this mark found only upon ſuch as are in an eſtate of Salvation? I cannot prove that this is a Man from any ſuch part or principle as is common to a brute with him. My proofs muſt pitch upon what is proper to Mankind. He is a Rational Creature, therefore a Man. For Man only is that Creature upon Earth, which is endowed with Reaſon. It would be as great a weakneſs to argue my title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from any ſuch qualifications as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon even to them that ſhall be thruſt into Hell. The Apoſtle therefore noteth it as a vain and empty crack in thoſe ſolifidians, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they inſiſted barely upon believing, and thence infer'd their Bleſſedneſs and Salvation; whereas the Devils might put in a claim upon this account, to the Heavenly Kingdom as well, if not more than they, if a faith without works might be admitted for an evidence. <hi>For the Devils alſo believe and tremble,</hi> ver. 19. Though <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake with tongues more than they all, who took thoſe and other ſuch gifts as evidences of Salvation: yet he thinks fit to tell them, <hi>Though I ſpeak with the tongues of men and of angels,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:135216:109"/>though I have the gift of Propheſie, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledg, and though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have no charity,</hi> (the diſcriminating character of the devout and thorough Chriſtian) <hi>I am nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.18. <hi>c.</hi> 13.1, 2. So then, the mark which Conſcience ſingleth out to diſcuſs and determine your eſtate by, muſt be proper to, and which is alone predicable of, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and ſaved ones of God. Not ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition wherein hypocrites may partake with you. It was by this <hi>Job</hi> defended his Integrity, and defeated the accuſations of his enemies. <hi>Will the hypocrite delight himſelf in the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Will he always call upon God?</hi> And our Saviour's queſtion will be, <hi>What do you more than others? Do not even the Publicans the ſame?</hi> And he ſtrictly concludeth, <hi>Except your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Job 27.6.—11. Mat. 5.46, 47. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. 3. Is this mark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible? <hi>i.e.</hi> Are all they upon whom this mark is found in a ſaving eſtate? And have all that are in a ſaving eſtate, this mark found upon them? Right Properties are reciprocally predicable of the Subjects, whoſe Properties they are. All that are ſaved are hearers of the Word. But all that are hearers of the Word are not ſaved. This they did deliberate, and ſo deceived themſelves: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22. <hi>See then that you be doers of the word, and not hearers only.</hi> All they that are ſuch ſhall be ſaved; and all that ſhall be ſaved are ſuch: <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:135216:109"/>
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.28. Whoſoever are in a ſtate of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation do profeſs ſpecial dearneſs to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion for the Lord and Saviour. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever profeſs this are not therefore in a ſtate of Salvation. This they did not attend, and ſo abuſed themſelves: <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24.—28. The propriety between Chriſt and the Church is mutual. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> The promiſe is mutual, <hi>I will ſay, thou art my people; and they ſhall ſay, thou art my God: Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.23. See that the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon which you proceed, will be ſuch too, that the terms will reciprocate. As the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, is unto all, and upon all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And all that believe are intereſted in this righteouſneſs. <hi>The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him in truth.</hi> And all they that call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in truth, are nigh unto the Lord: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.18. Would you but improve theſe rules, in and for the trial of thoſe marks in the review of which you are to make trial of your eſtates; the deceitful evidences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by multitudes unto themſelves, would ſoon diſappear, and no more ſtand before the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of Conſcience than the duſt, which is eaſily driven before the wind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Treaſure up theſe marks in order to the trial of thy ſelf. Make Conſcience the ſacred Repoſitory of ſuch marks and rules. Or if Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory be this Cloſet and Repoſitory, let Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be ſure to keep the Key. Beſides the advantages which thou ſhalt hereby reap, for a ſolemn ſelf-examination; they will ſuggeſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:135216:110"/>matter of ſelf-reflection, and inward ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes, in the ſeveral lines and periods of thy Secular Negotiations. <hi>Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tye them about thy neck: When thou goeſt it ſhall lead thee; when thou ſleepeſt it ſhall keep thee; and when thou awakeſt it ſhall talk with thee. For the Commandment is a lamp, and the Law is light; and reproofs of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are the way of life,</hi> Prov. 6.21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take forth what marks thou haſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up for trial, <hi>That as a Scribe inſtructed to the Kingdom of God, thou mayſt bring forth out of thy treaſure things both new and old,</hi> Mat. 13.52. There are three ſorts of Marks mentioned by Divines
<note n="*" place="margin">See Manton on James.</note>. 1. Excluſive; the abſence of which doth plainly ſpeak that we are not as yet in a ſtate of Grace and Salvation. 2. Incluſive; the preſence of which doth not only prove the truth of our Grace, or being in the ſtate of Salvation, but our growth in Grace and progreſs in Sanctification. 3. Beſide thoſe, there are a middle ſort of Marks which they call poſitive. The preſence of which doth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively and plainly ſhew, the being or integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Graces, the truth of our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that we are in a ſtate of Salvation. Touching theſe I ſhall offer you ſome rules, in the caſe before you. 1. Do not decline Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive Marks, which have their end, and are of efficacy to undeceive and convince of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and hypocriſie. That a man deceive not his own heart, there is uſe of the Excluſive Mark: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.26. <hi>He that ſeems to be religious and bridleth not his tongue, this mans religion is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:135216:110"/>vain;</hi> as well as of that more evidential and poſitive, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. Prayer and other acts of Worſhip will not prove you in a ſtate ſaving; but if you caſt off Worſhip, and reſtrain Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer before God, it will prove you in a ſtate of ſin. Hearing his truths will not prove the acceptation of your perſons by God; But if you turn away your ear from hearing the Law, it will prove that your prayers are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Job</hi> 15.4. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9. 2. Do not dwell upon Excluſive Marks, much leſs ſhouldſt thou draw them down to the ends and uſes of ſuch as are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive; as if reading and hearing Sermons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would ſpeak thee to be in a ſaving ſtate. For, as they are unable to do this, ſo thou wilt hereby but deceive thy own ſelf; whereof you have already ſeen ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inſtances. 3. Draw forth and improve thy poſitive Marks; which I ſuppoſe thee to have tried and treaſured up according to the two former Directions. Now is the time to bring them forth out of thy armory; when thou art in hazard of thy life, and thy heart lyeth open to all the aſſaults, which either the policies or power of Sin and Satan can bring on againſt thee, to captivate, or enſnare thee. The Apoſtle therefore directs them now to produce faith and fellowſhip with Chriſt, when they are upon proving and examining themſelves, and to aſcertain their eſtares. And now it is, that <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David</hi> awaken their memories to recall, and do apply ſuch Marks to themſelves, when they are about clearing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135216:111"/>their caſe before God, and in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: <hi>Job</hi> 23.10, 11, 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.1, 2, 3, 4. Draw forth thy poſitive Marks for a full and final deciſion in what eſtate thou art, or for poſitive ends: That thou leave not thy eſtate at an hovering uncertainty, in looſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, or languiſhing probabilities, but bring it to a clear and certain iſſue, in thy own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſo aſſure thy heart before God: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. And indeed, why have you ſuch poſitive Marks afforded on God's part, but to this end? or how can you anſwer ſo many obligations as are plainly required on your part, that cannot be performed without the previous knowledg of your eſtate? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.21. The Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians therefore would not ſuffer themſelves to ſit down in opinionative gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or hopeful conjectures only, but purſued their Marks to a peremptory, but modeſt knowledg of what condition they were in. <hi>Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments. Hereby know we, that we are in him. We know that we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the Brethren, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.3, 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3.14, 19, 24. <hi>c.</hi> 5.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Touching the Aſſumption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Conſcience delivereth her teſtimony and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, in the management of this ſelf-trial, how 'tis with us as to matter of fact, with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the matter of law or rule, contained in the former Propoſition. Here I adviſe.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Let Conſcience diſcuſs the truth thereof before ſhe determines on her teſtimony. The
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135216:111"/>
                  <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> reflects and revolves the caſe upon his thoughts ere Conſcience ſhall make report. Nor will he adventure to determine without a diligent ſelf-diſcuſſion, <hi>I commune with my own heart, and my ſpirit made diligent ſearch.</hi> And ſurely 'tis no leſs our duty than his, whoſe danger as being leſs fallible, is far more: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Laodicea</hi> might eaſily have diſproved that falſe teſtimony, <hi>Thou ſayeſt I am rich and encreaſed with goods, and have need of nothing.</hi> If ſhe had but diſcuſſed it firſt in her own thoughts, but being careleſs in this, <hi>ſhe knew not that ſhe was miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked, Rev.</hi> 3.17. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.41. <hi>We have one Father, even God.</hi> Our Saviour returns the ſpeech to a further ſearch of Conſcience, which might eaſily correct ſuch a miſtake and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as this, <hi>Nay, if God were your Father, ye would love me, for I proceeded forth and came from God, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 42, 44, 45. The like he doth, <hi>ver.</hi> 33, 34, 39, 40. We were never in bondage ſay they, we are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, and he is our father; and no doubt they ſpeake according to the ſuffrage of their Conſcience. But he remits it to ſecond and more ſerious conſiderations. <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſin is the ſervant of ſin. If ye be Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But ye ſeek to kill me, &amp;c. this did not Abraham.</hi> 'Tis requiſite then that you return the teſtimony once and again to a further reflection and review of Conſcience. Sometimes 1. the calling back of Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may confute the vanity and falſhood of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:135216:112"/>ſuch a Teſtimony. Would <hi>Babylon</hi> have ſaid, <hi>I ſhall be a Lady for ever,</hi> if ſhe had laid theſe things to heart? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.6, 7. Or thoſe in <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us;</hi> if they had but looked backwards and lain hold upon the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their diſobedience? <hi>ver.</hi> 9.10. 2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the calling in of ſenſe; as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.23. <hi>How canſt thou ſay I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? See thy way in the Valley, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Moſt times the calling over and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with Scriptures, which pierce like a two-edged ſword, <hi>even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, and maketh manifeſt the ſecrets thereof to it ſelf,</hi> unto a ſound Conviction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. 4. But would we carry on the converſe in our own Conſcience, we ſhould not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fail of the effect, either in clearing and confirming the truth, or confuting the falſhood, of what our Conſcience witneſſeth. Doth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſay, They that have fellowſhip with God are in an happy ſtate. But we have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God? Put her to the proof of the Aſſumption in a ſecond practical Syllogiſm; as thus, <hi>They that have fellowſhip with God walk in the light,</hi> (i.e. <hi>live holily) for God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all. But we walk in the light,</hi> (i.e. <hi>live holy and uprightly.</hi>) This confirms. Or on the other hand thus, <hi>They that walk in darkneſs</hi> (i.e. <hi>that are ignorant and diſobedient), have no fellowſhip with God.</hi> But we w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lk in darkneſs. This confuteth. <hi>If we
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:135216:112"/>ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lie and do not the truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.5, 6, 7. The Scriptures therefore do frequently offer to the application of Conſcience, both negative Marks and poſitive together; that by the application of the former we may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our miſtakes; and by the latter we may confirm our minds, in what is aſſumed by Conſcience, as to our being in Chriſt, and in a condition of Bleſſedneſs; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.20.—25. And the Apoſtle thinks it fit to ſubjoyn ſometimes to the teſtimony of his Conſcience; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon which that teſtimony was raiſed, and from whence it reſulted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. 5. The crediting of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence its teſtimony therefore in ſuch Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are capable of further proof, is not ſafe for us ordinarily without the calling in, and conſidering of thoſe proofs firſt had and made. And it is of ſingular uſe in ſuch a caſe, to put Conſcience afreſh to the queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes to a Concluſive determination, that ſuch a teſtimony is of indubitable truth. As, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt;</hi> (a Propoſition of infallible verity.) But I am in Chriſt, ſaith Conſcience: This Aſſumption ſhould be again put to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and requireth proof and confirmation, as the Apoſtle ſeems to imply, by adding ſo many Characteriſtical ſigns, <hi>They that are in Chriſt walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; are made free from the Law of ſin and death. i.e.</hi> from the prevailing and binding power
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:135216:113"/>thereof. In ſuch the body is dead becauſe of ſin, and the ſpirit is life becauſe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Can Conſcience now again aſſume? But this is our walk, we are thus free, our ſins thus mortified, and our ſpirits thus vivifyed to righteouſneſs and holineſs. Or as elſewhere, <hi>They that are in Chriſt are new Creatures.</hi> Doth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſay, we are new Creatures? Preſs her to give you the proof of what ſhe ſaith: They that are new Creatures have old things paſt away, all things are become new; have put off the old man, and put on the new. And now attend whether Conſcience can aſſume, as in the preſence of God. All things are paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, all things are become new in and to us, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8.1, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22, 24.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Let Conſcience deliberate, before ſhe delivers in her Teſtimony. Bethink thy ſelf, and bring this witneſs (as they were their wickedneſs, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.47.) back again to thine heart. <hi>Conſider your ways, and let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God. David</hi>'s haſte did more than once diſturb his peace, and drew the <hi>Jews</hi> into a fools Paradiſe: <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.5, 7. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.2. Know therefore this day and conſider it in thine heart. 1. To and before whom ſhe is to render this witneſs or report. 'Tis not to thy ſelf only but unto God alſo. He knoweth the way that thou doſt take. <hi>The heart</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is deceitful above all things, who can know it? I the Lord ſearch the heart, I try the reins, &amp;c. Job.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, 10. O my Conſcience,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:135216:113"/>if thou ſhalt not ſpeak home and ſpeak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, ſhall not God ſearch it out? for he knoweth the ſecrets of the heart. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God trieth the heart and reins. Doſt thou bear this witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. 2. What the rule or mark is, according to which ſhe is thus to witneſs and report. Compare Spiritual things with Spiritual; thy ſelf not with thy ſelf; but with the ſign or ſtandard, by which thou art to meaſure thy ſtate. Take not only an occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or tranſient view of what that ſpeaketh, and thou art or doſt. But let thy conſultations therewith be frequent, ordinary, deliberate, deep. <hi>Who ſo looketh into the perfect Law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and continueth therein, he being not a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed:</hi> 2 Cor. 10.12. Jam. 1.23, 24, 25. 3. What reaſon is there that ſhe ſhould make this report. O my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how canſt thou clear up this thy Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? Of which before. 4. What will be the reſult of this witneſs or report? Shouldſt not thou now deal faithfully with me, what a fearful deluge of preſumption, &amp;c. would henceforth overflow me! and what floods of dedolence, pride, &amp;c. would henceforth alſo oppreſs! My converſion will be leſs poſſible, and thy condemnation and torment more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing and full of horrour: <hi>Act.</hi> 28.26, 27. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.27, 28, 29.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Let Conſcience be dealt with truly and impartially by thee, that ſhe may deal forth a true and impartial teſtimony to thee. 1. Charge
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:135216:114"/>her to be herein true and thorow with thee. By her concernment in it. Who ſhall witneſs if Conſcience do not? <hi>For no man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man, which is in him.</hi> God hath ſet thee, O my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as that heap and pillar to be a witneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.52. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. By her Commands for it. God hath choſen her for this purpoſe, and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her in his Laws, to be a Miniſter and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both of thoſe things which ſhe hath ſeen, (like <hi>Paul</hi>) and of thoſe things in the which he ſhall appear to her: <hi>Rom. ibid.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.16. By the Covenant and Oath of God, which ſhe hath taken for it. The vows of God are upon thee, to be a faithfulful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that will not lie. And wouldſt thou have him to be a ſwift Witneſs againſt thee? <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. By the conſequence of it to her, as well as thee; by the bleſſed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on the one hand, by the bitter effects on the other. 2. Keep off ſuch as would tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with her, and either keep her from giving witneſs, or corrupt her in the witneſs ſhe doth give. <hi>Keep thine heart with all diligence.</hi> Sin is ready to buy off her teſtimony with its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; Senſe, to bribe her with its profits; Satan, to befool and enſnare her with his policies. <hi>Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation.</hi> Set a guard upon Conſcience. Let not theſe come nigh the corner of her houſe. <hi>He that doth keep his ſoul ſhall be far from them:</hi> Prov. 4.23. Mat. 26.41. Prov. 22.5. 3. Cloſe with her Teſtimony, though
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:135216:114"/>ſhe ſpeak againſt thee. Let not thy Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions kick, and thy Will caſt it back upon Conſcience, to give a more favourable witneſs for thee. 'Tis better Conſcience ſhould be a ſevere Witneſs here, than a never-dying Worm hereafter. The more fully and faithfully ſhe teſtifieth, the more friendly is ſhe, and the more it turneth to thy felicity. <hi>Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kiſſes of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my are deceitful,</hi> Pſal. 141.5. Prov. 27.6.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Let Conſcience be told ever and anon of the Teſtimony ſhe muſt deliver in the day of Judgment. Then the Books ſhall be opened, the Book of Conſcience within, as well as of Creatures and Scriptures without. Then muſt thou, ſhalt thou, O my Conſcience, give a plain and impartial Teſtimony to all things done in the body. Then all thy frauds and fallacies, which thou now putteſt upon me, ſhall be unvailed and pluckt off, before God, Men and Angels. Then ſhalt thou bear the ſhame of them, and muſt ſuffer for them. Thy flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and unfaithfulneſs ſhall be all laid bare and open. Oh how much better were it for thee, and me, to bring forth thy righteous Teſtimony now to our Converſion, than in that day to our Confuſion! Alas! what can be hid from him who knoweth all things? <hi>Doth not he that pondereth the heart conſider it?</hi> Thou mayſt deceive me, but canſt thou deceive my God alſo? That day ſhall diſcover it. If thou feareſt the ſhame and ſting of ſuch a Witneſs in this day, ſhouldſt not thou rather fear and fly the ſhame and ſting thereof in that day?
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:135216:115"/>Now it may be eaſed and healed by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Defer thy Teſtimony till then, and the ſhame and torment will be eaſleſs, endleſs and remedileſs: <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.44.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Let Conſcience be demanded to give her Witneſs as in the preſence of God the great Judg. Charge her to ſpeak to thee, as ſhe would ſpeak to and before him. Is not the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God? O my Conſcience, is not God greater than thy ſelf, and knoweth all things? Wilt thou witneſs this thing to God for me, as <hi>Peter</hi>'s did? <hi>Thou knoweſt all things, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that I love thee.</hi> And canſt thou appeal him as a Witneſs in the caſe, with and for thee, as he alſo did? Canſt thou atteſt him? as they did, (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.21, 22.) <hi>The Lord God of Gods, the Lord God of Gods, he knoweth.</hi> Canſt thou ſay, and ſay truly, <hi>Behold my witneſs is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and my record is on high,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> did? And wilt thou anſwer to him for me, what thou now anſwereſt me as before him? <hi>Lo! O Lord, thou knoweſt. Thou, O Lord, knoweſt me, thou haſt ſeen me and tried mine heart. Thou haſt tried me, and ſhalt find nothing. Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked:</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. 1 Joh. 3.20. Joh. 21.15, 17. Job 16.19. Pſal. 40.9. Jer. 12.3. Pſal. 17.3. Job 10.7.</p>

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Touching the Concluſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Conſcience is to denounce the ſentence, upon the trial made, agreeable to the truth ſhe dictateth in the Propoſition, and to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which ſhe delivereth in the Aſſumption. Here I adviſe,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:135216:115"/>(1) See that Conſcience pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon thee. Or why are all theſe proceeds hitherto? Why are 1. the word and ſtatutes of Heaven conſulted? 2. The Court ſet? 3. The Witneſs ſworn and heard? Shall the Records of Heaven be produced, and the Records of my Heart proved to no purpoſe? Haſt thou done ſo many things, O my Conſcience in vain, if it ſhall be yet in vain? But becauſe Conſcience is ſo prone to protract the ſentence, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the concluſion, which ſhould follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Premiſſes, and doth naturally and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary follow upon the Propoſition and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in a Logical diſcourſe, as one well obſerveth
<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Ameſ. de Conſc. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. §. 5.—10.</note>. I adviſe theſe things, 1. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be ſilent, ſuſpect thy condition is not well, or that (at leaſt) it is not well with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. I ſhall not ſay, that her ſuſpending of the Concluſion doth always ſpeak the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtate of the Soul to be a ſtate of ſin. Becauſe deſerted Saints through the power of fear and temptations, and the weakneſs of their faith in ſuch troubles may not be able to derive and draw it down to themſelves. But ordinarily (and out of the caſe of deſertion) it ſpeaks the condition ill, and lyable to ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 'Twas not well with <hi>David,</hi> when he turns the concluſion and ſentence to another, which he ſhould have taken to himſelf, and the Prophet was fain to take up the office of Conſcience, and tell him, <hi>Thou art the man, &amp;c.</hi> He cannot be apprehended to have been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of God's Law, or of his own laſcivious and murtherous fact. But Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:135216:116"/>did not conclude, or argue and apply it home. And it was very ill with them, who knowing the judgment of God, that they who did ſuch things were worthy of death, and that they did them, yet concluded not their eſtate upon it, but continued in their ſin. Nor was their condition ſafe, or Conſcience ſound, that could wave the Concluſion, when the Premiſſes were ſo clear, <hi>Neither ſay they in their heart, let us now fear the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 5.23, 24. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.5, 6, 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. 2. If Conſcience do not ſpeak to thee, do thou ſpeak to Conſcience. God complaineth when men do not ſet and ſay to their hearts, when they do not call upon and converſe with them: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.19. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.2. Argue it with her, and urge her to proceed to ſentence, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect her diſcourſe in giving judgment. Urge her by her paſt proceeds (of which before.) By her place and power. Hath not God made thee a Judg in Iſrael, ſet thee next under him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and over me, that thou ſhouldſt ſhew me the ſentence in judgment? Is not thy commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Divine? His concurrence declared, who is with you in the judgment to behold if thou judgeſt falſly, to approve if thy judgment be according to verity? <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.9. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20, 21. By her Precedency. Thou expecteſt from inferiour Judges that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to judgment, and wilt expoſtulate and rebuke them if they ſhall adventure to retard it, and judgment goeth not forth. Thou art ſuperiour to any, to all of them. God hath ſet thee (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſet his Mother) next himſelf
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:135216:116"/>on the Throne. And if thou ſhalt clear, no matter if they all condemn me. But if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, not all of them can quit me. May not they dare to adventure upon unneceſſary delays in Civil concernments, and durſt thou to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and defer the ſentence in Spiritual, in Soul-matters, and of eternal conſequence? <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.18, 19, 20. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.4. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. By her Principles. Civil Judges have ſeverals to conſult without them, ere they can come to ſentence. But thou, O my Conſcience, containeſt all within thee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mayſt be both clear and quick, or expeditious in the judgment. Thou needſt not call for Law-books, or foreign Witneſſes. With thee is a treaſury of Laws, and thou art more than a thouſand Witneſſes. 3. If Conſcience yet ſuſpends judgment, cite her before the ſupream Judg. Behold Conſcience, <hi>the Judg ſtandeth before the door.</hi> He is greater than the Conſcience, to him thou muſt accompt. Thou mayſt apologize to me, but how wilt thou anſwer it to him, who made thee his deputy, and ſubſtituted thee upon this very deſign? And hath ſaid to Conſcience, as <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi> to his Judges, <hi>Take heed what ye do, for ye judg not for man but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment: Wherefore take heed, and do it:</hi> Jam. 5.9. 1 Joh. 30.20. 2 Chron. 19.5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) See that Conſcience pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence fully and clearly upon thee. An half-ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence can give but half-ſatisfaction. If the ſentence be dubious, thy Soul will ſtill be in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:135216:117"/>the dark. Why all this pains? Not for airy hopes, but for aſſurance of the heart before God: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. To this end, 1. Be full and clear with Conſcience, in expoſing all thou art and doſt, to her ſentence, without any of the reſtraints of ſelf-love, without any reſerve for any ſecret luſts. Self-love will be putting in for her immunities. A clear and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial ſentence will ſhake all her foundations hitherto of quiet and ſelf-eaſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore importuneth Conſcience, as <hi>David</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time did his chief Commanders, <hi>Deal gently for my ſake, yea and for thy own ſake:</hi> for thou muſt ſuſtain the effects of ſuch a ſentence: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. <hi>cum</hi> 5. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.5. Secret luſts will be putting in for an indemnity, which it may be Conſcience hath cockered, or (at leaſt) hitherto connived at. <hi>Wherefore ſhould we be ſlain? Have not we took ſweet counſel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and walked to the houſe of God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, &amp;c.</hi> But Conſcience muſt quit them ere it can clear thec. 'Twill be a partial ſentence, if ſhe parteth not with theſe ſins. Or if ſhe ſpeak peace, it will be but the ſhew and paint of it, ſo long as ye will walk after the imagination of your own hearts: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12, 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. Bring all then before the Bar of Conſcience, and that Bar without any vails or coverts; and tell her (as <hi>Cornelius</hi> told <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>we are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God:</hi> Act. 10.33. 2. Be free, yet cloſe with Conſcience. You may remember her, there will be another <hi>audit,</hi> and what will attend, if ſhe ſhall give a looſe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:135216:117"/>or partial judgment, <hi>Curſed be he that perverteth judgment.</hi> But remember her withal that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this thy appearance is made before her throne of Judicature, and thou demandeſt it as thy right; not as a matter of courteſie from her, but as of debt and duty. As of old, it was ordained, <hi>Thou ſhalt come to the Judg and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and he ſhall ſhew thee the ſentence of judgment,</hi> Deut. 27.19. <hi>c.</hi> 17.9. See thou do not ſee her by any carnal indulgence, <hi>for a gift blindeth the eyes of the wiſe and perverteth the words of righteouſneſs;</hi> and fire ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the tabernacles of bribery: <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.19, <hi>Job</hi> 15.34. Nor flatter her by any corrupt inducements. <hi>The flattering mouth worketh ruin. Pſal.</hi> 36.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.28. Be plain with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Lo, I have now put my ſelf, my ſtate, my ſalvation upon thy ſentence. 'Tis thy work to condemn or clear me; thy eternal wo or weal is concerned in it. I require thee, as before the ſupream and all-ſeeing Judg, to judg righteouſly. I do not ſollicite for favour, but ſeek juſtice at thy mouth. How long ſhall I take counſel in my ſoul? When wilt thou bring it to a concluſion, that I may know my eſtate, what I am? Follow her with arguments and importunities, till ſhe anſwereth thee, in the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, I will judg uprightly, Pſal.</hi> 75.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:135216:118"/>Q. 4. <hi>How may we difference the Peace of a good and of an evil Conſcience? and ſo diſcern that ours is a ſound and an Evangelical Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doubtleſs there is a difference
<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Fenner</hi>'s <hi>Treat. of Conſc. p.</hi> 137. <hi>to</hi> 167. <hi>Robinſons</hi> Chriſt all in all. <hi>p.</hi> 187, 188 <hi>Collin</hi>'s right way to true peace. <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>ad</hi> 62.</note>, or our Saviour had not delivered it as he doth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27. <hi>cum</hi> 22. But he that would drive this nail to the head, for the diſcovery of his own peace, whether it be true or falſe, ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs it thorowly with his own Conſcience, how it came to take up this peace. The peace that an evil Conſcience bears, groweth uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally out of one of theſe two roots. 1. Either out of the ſluggiſhneſs of Conſcience that puts not the eſtate upon trial. 2. Or from the ſhifts and unfaithfulneſs of Conſcience if it proceed to trial. 1. Fither in the Propoſition 2. Or in the Aſſumption. 3. Or in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as hath been ſhewed. You ſhould dig to the very bottom in this buſineſs. Whether this peace be the product of pains, prayers, and of proving your hearts and ſtates once and again? What pains did Conſcience take in it? What proceed did Conſcience make in it? Did it give full and infallible marks for the trial of your eſtates? Did it give a faithful and impartial teſtimony in the trial. And did it give a free and unbiaſſed judgment upon the trial of your eſtates. Produce and prove thy Evidences; That your enmity againſt godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is turned into peace, and therewith amity. That you are as earneſt for holineſs, as you were for ſin, or are for happineſs; and as
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:135216:118"/>great a friend to the purity, as to the peace of Conſcience. Prove that the ſpirit of peace hath renewed and ſanctified you. That the Prince of Peace Chriſt Jeſus ruleth in, and hath the Soveraignty over you. That the God of peace is related, as a Father to you, and is that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream good and end to whom you finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your ſelves in point of felicity and duty; and then your peace (which is gathered from theſe Premiſſes) is proved therewith to be true, pious, and Evangelical. But to give you the difference enquired after, though every thing I herewith offer doth not ſerve to diſcover it effectually in ſuch a practical inquiry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome further reference.</p>
               <p>The Evangelical peace of the good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the quiet or peace of an evil Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are different.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the eminency of this Evangelical Peace.</hi> 1. In point of truth. That other is but the ſhadow and ſemblance of peace, but this is ſolid, ſubſtantial peace. 'Tis peace, peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3. <hi>c.</hi> 57.19. not only the reſemblance or appearance of peace; but real; rich, aſſured, abundant peace. <hi>But there is no peace, ſaith my God, unto the wicked,</hi> ver. 21. Iſa. 48.22. Let men call it by the title of peace, yet God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it to be in truth no peace. (2) In point of tranquillity. That other is moſtly but nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, a freedom from ſtorms, but this is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive a fulneſs of ſerenity. There Conſcience is aſleep, and therefore quiet; but here it's awake and at work, and therefore are they comforted; yea, filled oft-times with comfort,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:135216:119"/>under variety of croſſes. They are not only not vexed, not frighted, or only fed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but find a continual feaſt in the peace of their Conſcience: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.15. (3) In point of tranſcendency. That ſoon evaporates into airy imaginations, and intoxicates affections. But this peace is both ſerious and ſuperlative. The Soul feels what the other never found, or can fathom. Nay he feels more than himſelf can utter, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed comprehenlively underſtand. This peace paſſeth all underſtanding; not only others, but his own: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. (4) In the principle transfering it. <hi>Peace I leave with you,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you:</hi> Joh. 14.27. (5) In the proper treaſury of it. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that in me ye might have peace:</hi> Joh. 16.33. This is not a peace then of the world's giving, nor of our own getting. We neither get it of our ſelves, nor get it out of our ſelves. 'Tis a peace of Chriſts giving; the Chriſtian goeth to him for it, in the purity of peace, and glorieth in him as the procurer and peculiar object of his peace. He is our peace, ſay Believers: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In the extent of Evangelical peace.</hi> See (1) from what it extendeth it ſelf. 1. From the indwelling of Satan. He like a ſtrong man armed keeps the other's heart as his houſe, and ſo its peace, while his poſſeſſion is undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed. Being willing captives, in whom he works effectually, he ſuffers them to walk at
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:135216:119"/>eaſe and quiet: <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. But this peace alway preſuppoſeth his diſpoſſeſſion, and deveſtment from power; the binding of him for you, and the bruiſing of him under you, the taking of his armor from him, and treading of him under the feet of you. <hi>The God of peace ſhall bruiſe, or tread ſatan under your feet ſhortly,</hi> Luk. <hi>ibid. &amp;</hi> 22. Col. 1.13. Rom. 16.20. 2. From the dominion of ſin. The ſecurity of the evil Conſcience is, in that ſin hath the entire command, and ſuffers not conviction to embroil Conſcience: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Evangelical ſecurity is founded upon the excuſſion of ſin, and extruſion thereof out of command and authority in the Soul. While ſin reigns there is no ſound reſt. <hi>To be carnally minded is death; to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace,</hi> Pſal. 19.13. Rom. 2.8, 9, 10. <hi>c.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11. <hi>c.</hi> 8.6. 3. From the diſpleaſure of God. The tranquillity of evil Conſciences is taken up moſtly, either from God's ſeeming ſilence at their ſins, and ſuſpending of his ſeverities, or from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs of what he threatens, and ſhifting it from themſelves to others, or from the ſmiles of his providence upon them in common en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments and bleſſings. When yet all this while he reſerves his anger, and it ſhall ſmoke againſt ſuch ſinners: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21, 22. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. But Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical peace extends it ſelf beyond God's not puniſhing, or not threatning, or not being provoked, and beyond God's proſpering and preſerving. His comforts are, that God is his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:135216:120"/>portion, God is pleaſed, his perſon juſtified, and his works accepted. His cares are how he may pleaſe God, and walk worthy of his good pleaſure; and never is he ſo cheery as in the Conſcience of this, that he pleaſeth God, which trieth our hearts: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.32. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. In examining then the truth of this peace, let theſe be ſome of thy principal enquiries. Whether Satan was ever diſturbed and dethroned, and thy Soul delivered from under his power, in the dominion of the Prince of Peace, and to do and endure his pleaſure? Whether ſin be dead in thee, and thou to ſin, and thy Soul deſireth as well peace from ſin and power againſt ſin, as to be preſerved from ſmart and anguiſh? Whether God be pleaſed with thee, and thy greateſt care be to pleaſe him, and to commend thy Conſcience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to his ſight and approbation?</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>See what this Evangelical Peace extendeth it ſelf unto.</hi> 1. To all the ſubject, the whole Conſcience, yea the whole Chriſtian to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, keep, confirm him in his Communion with God. But eſpecially it ſhall keep your hearts and minds, and theſe in believing, your inward powers in the inward power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. 2. To all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, for the enjoyment of it ſelf under them, and the improvement of it ſelf by them. While he ſenſeth this peace, he can ſwallow any perſecution; nor only rejoyce in hope of the glory of God, but glory in tribulation alſo, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. (3) To all the Cauſes; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:135216:120"/>ſubordinate. <hi>Supream,</hi> Oh! how it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it ſelf to the God of Peace, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in an enriching Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, an exact Conformity to them, and a moſt endearing Complacency in and with them, while the God of Love and Peace is with theſe: <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Subordinate;</hi> How are their own feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace! and how beautiful are others feet to them that preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring the glad tydings of theſe good things! <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. Wouldſt try the truth of thy Peace? turn in hither, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the extent of it by theſe particulars: that falſe peace falls ſhort; and though (like thoſe Locuſts St. <hi>John</hi> mentioneth, which had the faces of men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.7, 10.) it may have ſome appearance of, and approaches toward this peace; yet as they were fierce and far from the nature of men, ſo it is utterly alien from, and adverſe unto it in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In the efficient, matter, form, and end of this Evangelical Peace.</hi> Theſe kinds of peace are widely different, when the cauſes are ſo wide and different.

The <hi>Procatarctick.</hi> Came it through and by the blood of Chriſt? Peace of Conſcience is of Chriſt's procuring. He got it for you by the merit of Redemption. He gives it to you by the ſpirit of Regeneration. This Man ſhall be the peace when Divine juſtice on the one hand, or the Devil on the other hand, like the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> ſhall invade Conſcience: <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.5. Is the blood of his Croſs then that peace-offering you preſent unto the Father? the peace you plead for, is it upon the account of your ſervice, or of his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? of your deſerts, or of his death for you? There is no preaching peace but by Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.36. The prime <hi>inſtruments</hi> of your peace, what were, or what are they? Was it the Goſpel of Peace? then will the Miniſtration and Miniſtry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be more beautiful in your eyes: <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.7. Was it the grace of faith? 'Tis firſt grace, then peace, throughout the Goſpel. No peace before grace, much leſs without grace. 'Tis believing in Chriſt that brings the calm upon the Conſcience. <hi>Being juſtified by faith
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:135216:121"/>we have peace with God,</hi> Rom. 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.3. Joh. 14.1. Rom. 5.1. Try your faith then, whether it be beyond temporary? whether it be truly juſtifying, ere you take up with peace? He cannot be the God of peace to you, if he be not the God of hope and faith unto you. <hi>The God of hope fill you with peace in believing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Enquire into the matter of your Peace, not ſo much that of which it conſiſteth, as about which it is converſant.</hi> To mention but an head or two. 1. Is it Communion with God? which conſiſts in that mutual relation, and thoſe mutual returns which paſs 'twixt God and a Believer in the deſcending of his graces, and aſcending of our duties. What ſay you? are theſe the matters that take up the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of your mind? the mutual intereſt that God and you have in each other, that he is yours, and you are his? the mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe that you have with each other, in his mercies and your duties? while he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh to you, in extending the grace of his favour, and you draw nigh to him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the graces of his Spirit. This, this is the heart of Evangelical Peace, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God; fellowſhip with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt. Here the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul doth lye down in Peace: <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 8. 2. Is it the Kingdom of God ſpecially in and over you? That falſe peace is never thorow in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and taketh its leave in this latter. It may be taken with God's love, but turns aſide
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:135216:122"/>from his laws, eſpecially from that part, which is croſs to his carnal intereſt. But Evangelical peace hath endearing and precious thoughts of the very laws, the rule and reſtraints of Divine Government. He rejoyceth and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſneſs, and the work of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is his peace, and rejoycing: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.165.—169. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.5. <hi>c.</hi> 32.17. How is Conſcience pleaſed then with the commands of God? in that he hath the dominion of Conſcience and will not diſpenſe with the leaſt corruptions, and will have the ducture of your whole Converſations? Read the language and reſolution herein of the good and peaceable Conſcience: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12, 13.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Enquire into the formal cauſe.</hi> There is no Goſpel-peace of Conſcience but what is ſpoken by God, thorow Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. The peace ſpoken by Conſcience through the Goſpel, ſtanding in an accord to what is ſpoken by Chriſt in the Goſpel. And it is not only therefore called the peace of God
<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 4.7.</note>, in that it is cauſed principally by him; he is the fountain of it. But in regard of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity thereof to his pleaſure, which gives form and being to it. Thus Evangelical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth not abſolve or juſtifie before or without God, but with and becauſe God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves and juſtifies
<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 5.1, 9.</note>. It 1. reads and reviews God's ſentence of peace in the Goſpel. <hi>Peace be with you all that are in Chriſt Jeſus. There is now no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt, &amp;c. As many as walk according to this rule peace ſhall be upon them.</hi> [1 Pet. 5.14.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:135216:122"/>Rom. 8.1. Gal. 6.16] 2. It reflects and reſumes. But I (who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit) am in Chriſt. I walk after this rule (as God himſelf is my witneſs.) Hence 3. he reports and agrees God's ſentence in the Goſpel to his own Soul in particular. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to me is peace. God hath cleared me, therefore Conſcience cleareth me. And ſo have I quietneſs in and confidence toward God. <hi>Behold my witneſs is in heaven, and my record is on high,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.21. Job 34.29. <hi>c.</hi> 16.19. Well then, it muſt be peace in Heaven, or there can be no peace (to ſpeak properly) in your hearts. Your hearts are at peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe heaven is at peace, and this heart-peace bears accord with heavens peace
<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 2.14. &amp; 19.38.</note>. And be ſure God can never ſpeak peace in you upon any other terms than he hath in the Goſpel ſpoken peace to you.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>Enquire into the final cauſe.</hi> This peace of God is finally for the God of peace; it ſits not down in ſelf-eaſe, but is ſet for his ſervice, and the enjoyment of himſelf. Yea, it not only purſueth good works, but would be made perfect to every good work. Nor doth this Soul content it ſelf in the ſweets of this joy and peace, but his care and chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter is, that in theſe things he ſerveth Chriſt: <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>chap.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17, 18. Whither doth your peace then extend, and where doth it terminate it ſelf? True peace of Conſcience can never take up ſhort of God in Chriſt. This is its earneſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and hope that ſhall be magnified, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:135216:123"/>his ſervice maintained, and his own Soul ſhall more abound in holineſs, and in hope through the power of the Holy Ghoſt. The thoughts of this heart are not only taken up about his own felicity and peace, but about the furtherance of God's praiſe, the fulfilling of his pleaſure, and the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs. <hi>If there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe,</hi> he thinks on theſe things: <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7, 8. In ſhort, as this peace is by reception from God, ſo its reſt is in and with God. It lifts up the Soul unto him, lifts him upmoſt in the Soul; lays its charge thereon to repoſe her ſelf upon him, to rejoyce in him, and upon every miſcarriage to return to him as her only reſt and center: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.4. <hi>c.</hi> 73.25, 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 62.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 116.7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The peace of a good and evil Conſcience are differenced in and by the effects of it.</hi> The peace of an evil Conſcience uſually renders men leſs circumſpect and inobſervant of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual dangers, more ſlight and overly in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Evangelical peace ends in (1) Greater vigilance over himſelf, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, ſatan, as alſo in the objects of ſenſe, that he turn not again to ſolly: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.19, 20. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.5, 6, 8, 9. Doth this peace then make you draw off your guards and centinels, or make you more diligent and circumſpect? (2) Greater fortitude of ſpirit; forbearing troubles, breaking thorow tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and baffling all the aſſaults of fleſh and blood upon the ſanctified habits and faculties.

This Soul not only maintains a courſe or track in ſpiritual matters, but manageth them with a ſpiritual mind. His ſpiritual peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a ſpiritual plenty; and now he can eaſily ſtep over what heretofore ſtumbled him. No offence is ſo great to him as that his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is no greater. He not only liveth up to Gods teſtimonies, but he loves him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.165.—169. Doth your peace then make you more ſlight and formal in duty, or more ſpiritual and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous? Are they not only more bulky, but more ſtrong and ſincere, fuller of the ſap of love, and of the ſpirit of life? (4) Greater vivacity of Holineſs. Evangelical peace is ever proſpered to Evangelical grace and growth. See how it fructifieth and cluſters:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:135216:124"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.—6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. Let the day of that falſe peace be as the harveſt-time to the formal hypocrite. His righteouſneſs is now all gathered into barn. But 'tis as the ſeed-time to the faithful ſoul. The fruit of righteouſneſs is ſown in peace: <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.18. Now is this Soul's time to be diſtributing the ſeeds of righteouſneſs for God and among men; and by the oyl of gladneſs to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe likewiſe of the oyl of grace. This holy peace puts him upon perfecting holineſs in himſelf, and provoking others Souls to take and taſte thereof likewiſe: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51.12, 13.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. <hi>May not the Soul that enjoys eaſe and tranquility after eminent troubles of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, infer that his is Evangelical peace?</hi>

There is a trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence and iniquity. <hi>Ahab</hi> is ſo troubled as he taketh his bed upon it; not for want of faith in, or forgiveneſs from God, but for want of the Vineyard.

There is a trouble that is but corporeal and bodily, through exceſs of Melancholy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is ſometimes mixt, ſometimes meerly ſuch. This diſordereth the imagination or fancy. This again diſtempereth the paſſions; theſe diſcompoſe the natural ſpirits; theſe again drive to and fro, and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the humours of the body; and ſo all is in a commotion, nothing is quiet. And now happily a mans own ſpirit falls upon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and an evil ſpirit from the Lord alſo from without. And then terrour taketh hold of him on every ſide, as it did upon <hi>Saul.</hi> But what are theſe troubles?

So that if thine be a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peace, thou art transformed into the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pattern. There is a change not only of ſome actions, but of thy eſtate; relative in thy Juſtification, real in thy Sanctification. True peace of Conſcience taketh its riſe from a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſenſe of this change: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Q. 5. <hi>What ſhould convinced Sinners do in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of Conſcience, as are conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are now in a ſinful and damnable condition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Queſtion long ſince ask'd, and anſwer'd, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, <hi>&amp;c. c.</hi> 16.30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet let it not

               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Accept of your Convictions and do not either put them off, or put them out, or preſs them down. They were pricked in their heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. But they abide the pain, are not angry with <hi>Peter,</hi> nor do they pluck out and throw away the arrow. The Jaylor trembleth, in ſuch an agony was he of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; yet he attempts not either to break priſon from Conſcience, or abuſe the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, who were now his Priſoners, or to precipitate his Comforts. To this end, 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member whence they come; from thy Spirit immediately, but mediately and originally from God's holy Spirit, which is firſt a ſpirit of bondage, then a ſpirit of adoption; firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth, then comforteth the Conſcience: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. Will you break his bands aſunder? Take heed, he will make them ſtronger if you continue to reſiſt. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o ſweetneſs, ſafety, if you cloſe and ſubmit: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.22. <hi>Job</hi> 36.8,—12. If you will not accept, either he'l away on the one hand, and then oh the hardneſs of your heart! Or elſe add amazement to your anguiſh on the other hand: <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. 2. Remember their concern, and whither they tend. Theſe ſetters are not like thoſe of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Baker, in order to your perdition, but like thoſe of his Butler, or of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s rather, in order to his preferment. Every pang and throw is preparatory to the new Birth, to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:135216:127"/>without which thou canſt not ſee the Kingdom of God; and ſo to thoſe conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are wont to enſue upon Chriſt's being formed in the heart. If the Spirit breaks, 'tis in order to binding up; if he prick and launce the heart, 'tis in order to the health and eaſe of his Patient. He is making way by theſe afflictive ſeverities, for the ſweets of Adoption: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, 38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. 3. Remember the conſequence. If you accept, you are half-way over this deep ford. While the Heart, the Will, which commands the other faculties, is ſo far won, the work is like to continue and frame well, to your eaſe and God's ends; who is ready to meet you, as the Father in the Parable did his prodigal Son, when he was yet a great way off: <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41, <hi>&amp;c. Luk.</hi> 15.20. And as your buſineſs will ſucceed the better, ſo your burden will ſit much the lighter, (the more you wince, the more you weaken and ſin wounds) you cut off advantages from Satan, and are more capable of improving ſound adviſe, and the Spirit's aſſiſtance. If you do not accept, ſee what attends. Happily a great dedolence and ſtupidity of Conſcience, which is a dreadful inſtance of Divine juſtice: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.30. But beyond a perhaps there will be greater dolor; either here, in the approaching arreſts of an abaſed Conſcience to repentance, or hereafter in the anger, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and continued gnawing of an accuſing Conſcience to eternal ruin: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.22, 23.</p>

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Avoid thoſe courſes which will defeat thee of the end and happy effect of theſe Convictions. So did they, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. They did not; Oh do not you. 1. Either ſtrangle theſe diſtreſſes of Conſcience, as if they were but a fit of Melancholy, a fooliſh Puſillanimity, or (at beſt) of no profit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency, as they take it: <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>Job</hi> 21.14, 15. How many thus ſeek to ſtifle Conſcience, as <hi>Herod</hi> ſought to ſlay Chriſt in the very Cradle! 2. Do not ſtudy to defer Conſcience; now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation. Oh! if thou didſt know in this <hi>thy day the things that belong to thy peace:</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. Luk. 19.42. <hi>Felix</hi> trembled when Conſcience took hold of him, but what doth he? He turns off the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher at the Bar, and this Preacher in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, till a more convenient time. He had now ſomething elſe to do, and we never read that Conſcience any more rebuked him: <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. 3. Do not ſeek to divert Conſcience, either by carnal pleaſures, as <hi>Saul</hi> did. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is moved, and he calls for the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. He doth not pray it away, but muſt have it played away from him. Or by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute of your callings as <hi>Cain</hi> did. Conſcience bruiſeth and torments him, and he falls upon building and travels: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14, 17, <hi>&amp;c. Gen.</hi> 4.16, 17. 4. Do not skin over theſe diſtreſſes with the formalities only of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the <hi>Jews</hi> often. When Conſcience within, or calamities without pinch them, they fall a praying and crying, but their
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:135216:128"/>heart was not right in them. <hi>Baalam</hi> quiets Conſcience with a few cold wiſhes, and cheap words, in commendation of God's Children. <hi>Ahab</hi> humbleth himſelf, puts on Sackcloth, and goeth ſoftly. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> will be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and become a Chriſtian. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> pays every one of his own, is not as bad as the <hi>Publican,</hi> is as prompt as any to pay the external dues of Religion: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 37. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.27. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11, 12. Theſe things will but skin over thy wounds without the ſpirit and life of Religion. They will but feſter inwardly without this, and ſooner or latter break out again, as they did in <hi>Magus, Ahab,</hi> and others. Much leſs ſhouldſt thou ſlubber it over with unpreſcribed and ſuperſtitious obſervations, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did; and have more wo's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them than any one ſort of men in all the Scriptures: <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.3,—14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. Do not ſwill away theſe diſtreſſes, and debauch thy Conſcience. If the other courſes are ill, this muſt needs be vile. Yet how many cry to Conſcience as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's ſometimes did to Chriſt, <hi>What have we to do with thee, Jeſus, thou Son of God? Art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> We would fain be merry, while we may. And if Conſcience be clamorous, the drunken rounds muſt out-voice Conſcience. They drink away their Cares and Conſcience. <hi>Surely this iniquity ſhall not be purged away till you die, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> Iſa. 22.12, 13, 14.</p>

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Awaken Conſideration to a juſt ſenſe of thy ſpecial corruption, and therewith of thy ſtate and condition. It was this that drove the nail to the head in their heart: <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. <hi>When they heard this</hi> (cum ver. 36.) <hi>they were pricked in their heart.</hi> They did not only cry out of the ſting, but of the ſerpent. <hi>Cain</hi> crieth out of his puniſhment. But a Chriſtian ſhould cry out with <hi>David</hi> of his provocation: <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. Why crieſt thou for thine affliction? thy ſorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity. (Saith the Lord) <hi>Becauſe thy ſins were encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I have done theſe things unto thee,</hi> Jer. 30.15. Now is the time to turn in upon thy ſin, and to take off thy precious Soul from this painted ſtrumpet; whoſe end thou ſeeſt, is bitter as wormwood, ſharp as a two-edged ſword. Now conſider your ways, now that your own doings have beſet you about, and the yoke of thy tranſgreſſions is bound upon thee by the hand of the Lord; they are wreathed and come up upon thy neck: <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.14. Fix not thy thoughts ſo much upon his wrath as thy wickedneſs. <hi>Thy way and thy doings have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured theſe things unto thee; this is thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs becauſe it is bitter, becauſe it reacheth unto thine heart,</hi> Jer. 4.18. <hi>c.</hi> 2.17. Nor ſhouldſt thou ſingle out only ſome ſtaring corruption, but ſet before thee thy ſtate and condition. Thus did they, <hi>Act.</hi> 12, <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. They looked upon their loſt eſtate, and on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as loſt and undone by ſin, as their

But complaints only will never honour God, or heal thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

Iſrael hath ſinned, &amp;c. Joſh.</hi> 7.10, 11. Complaints of thy ſin will be more acceptable to him, and advantageous to thee than complaints of thy ſuffering. Yet, neither is this enough, God expects to ſee thee working rather than to hear thee weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that thou be not ſo much querulous as induſtrious: <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39, 40.</p>

'Twill be ſome eaſe to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied your ſelves into anothers boſom, if it do not extricate you out of your ſtraits, and unload your burdens.

I doubt not to ſay, that God hath now guided thy feet into the way of peace: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13, 14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.79. But it is requiſite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that I be a little more particular. Well then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 5. Apply thy ſelf to the Lord of peace, and the Lord of peace unto thy ſelf. There is no peace with God, nor peace of Conſcience, but by Jeſus Chriſt. This is the <hi>Blaſtus</hi> whom you muſt make your friend, if you mean to find peace: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.36. <hi>c.</hi> 12.20. Peace is of his manifeſting, his meriting, his making.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) This peace is of his manifeſting and publiſhing. Men are naturally at a loſs in the means of peace. The way of peace have they not known. Nor had the Angels known it, but by the Church. Nor had the Church known it, but by Chriſt: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. <hi>c.</hi> 2.17. 'Tis he that hath reveal'd and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this hidden myſtery, how God might be fully righted, and manfully, yet freely recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled in his Goſpel, which is therefore called the Goſpel of peace: <hi>Act.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26. <hi>c.</hi> 10.15. See then that you apply your ſelf to and attend on him, in the conſcionable reading and hearing of his Goſpel; wherein he hath given forth both the Covenant and Conditions of Peace. But remember that you
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:135216:139"/>ſit not down with this, that he hath therein opened theſe things to your underſtandings, but be a reſtleſs ſolicitor till he hath opened your underſtandings alſo to theſe things, and given you an inward ſenſe and taſte of the Truths ſpoken to: <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.45. <hi>cum</hi> 32. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. For Chriſt is anointed with ability and authority, not only (as other Prophets) to preach peace to you, but (as being the great Prophet) to preach peace into you. Or (if you will rather) to preach you into a ſtate of peace, and that you may have peace in him the Preacher, and his peace in you: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. <hi>c.</hi> 15.11.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) 'Tis of his merit and procurement. <hi>The chaſtiſement, or puniſhment</hi> (as the <hi>Dutch</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it) <hi>of our peace was upon him,</hi> Iſa. 53.5. It would not conſiſt with the ſovereign plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and perfections to make peace with us, without ſome puniſhment or propitiation from or for us. There muſt be a price, ſome compenſation, or there could be no peace, no reconciliation. Now Chriſt undertaketh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence God, and reconcile man. And lo! he hath born the puniſhment, laid down the price, and ſo bought out peace by the Blood of his Croſs, for all that ſhall believe in him, that he may bring them nigh to God, and God unto them: <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13,—17. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>c.</hi> 3.18. And now what is behind, but faith in his blood? An active faith on thy part, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou maiſt accept and appropriate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for thine, and apply the blood of his Croſs
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:135216:140"/>to thee, would alleviate thy troubles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford tranquility: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>c.</hi> 1, 9, 10. <hi>c.</hi> 8.34. You have the blood of ſprinkling, that ſpeaks better things than the blood of <hi>Abel;</hi> better things to God for you, and better things from God to you. But remember 'tis the hand of faith muſt ſprinkle this blood on the Conſcience. According to your faith ſo will it be to you, either peace or perplexity: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. <hi>c.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.29. Get you but faith to dip in this blood, and ſtrike the lintels of Conſcience therewith, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did the lintels and ſide-poſts of their houſes, there's no fear of the deſtroyer. Faith in his blood gives a full <hi>quietus eſt</hi> from the fears that generate bondage, and gives you boldneſs to enter into the holieſt: <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.22, 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) 'Tis of his making and applying too. 'Tis 1. of his free donation, as being the Prince of Peace, and that hath the key of <hi>David, who openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth:</hi> Joh. 14.27. Iſa. 9.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7. And 2. by vertue of his Dominion. There is no peace with God or Conſcience, while you perſiſt in your contumacy, and continue under the power of Sin and Satan. Theſe muſt be dethroned in and for you, and you muſt be delivered from their power, and muſt deliver up your ſelves to be his people, ere God can, without injury to his honour, his holineſs, declare himſelf to be at peace with you: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. Now 'tis Chriſt that muſt ſave you out of the hands of your
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:135216:140"/>enemies, ſlay the enmity in your hearts, and ſubdue your ſtubborn wills to the ſubjection and will of God, by the ſtrong but ſweet ducture of his omnipotent grace: <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.69, 71. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>cum</hi> 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.5. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. As ever you would come at peace then, you muſt by faith cloſe with him as your Prince. Peace is annexed to his Principality: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. Let him govern and be your Prince, and it will not be long ere he give you peace. His Kingdom conſiſts in righteouſneſs and peace. Only remember 'tis firſt righteouſneſs, then peace. Firſt King of Righteouſneſs, and after that alſo King of <hi>Salem,</hi> which is King of Peace. He firſt frameth the hearts of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to Piety, then to Peace: <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 6. Acquaint thy ſelf with the God of Peace. Hitherto thou haſt been alienated, and an enemy in thy mind to him by wicked works; and thou canſt not expect he ſhould be otherwiſe to thee till thou return and art reconciled: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. 'Tis high time to be upon better terms with God, or thou wilt be upon worſe terms ere long with Conſcience. Acquaint now thy ſelf with him, and be at peace. Now is the accepted time, if you will yet delay or dally, Conſcience will uſe a rougher dialect, and this thy day of peace will end in the darkneſs of amazing pangs and gripes of Conſcience: <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41, 42. Seeſt thou not how willing God is to an accord? or he would not invite thee to this acquaintance,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:135216:141"/>and ſo ſolemnly ſwear it, that he hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in thy death, and even pray thee out of this diſtance, and project ſuch means that his baniſhed may not be expelled from him: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. 2 Sam. 14.14. If God be ſo willing, why ſhouldſt thou be ſo wayward? Draw nigh to him, and he will draw nigh to thee. He is as willing to be friends as you are, or can be: <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. Do you ask me how ſhall we get acquaintance? I anſwer (1) You muſt be habituated for ſuch an high converſe. You may never look for acquaintance with God, ſo long as you are alienated from the life of God. Senſe doth not capacitate the brute Creatures for converſe with men; nor will reaſon ſimply capacitate men for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God. Reaſon fits for converſe with men; but 'tis Religion muſt fit us for converſe with God. Without his image there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe. <hi>Adam</hi> had no ſooner loſt that, but he loſt this alſo. The godly hath he ſet apart for himſelf: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 4.3. (2) You muſt accord all controverſies. For how can you be acquainted, while you are not yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed? <hi>Am.</hi> 3.3. To this end you muſt not only ceaſe provoking; but ſue out your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſubmit to his Propoſitions, and ſolicite him by prayer: <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.15. <hi>Job</hi> 33.26, 27, 28. (3) You muſt apply your ſelves to his company in the uſe of thoſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or ordinances, whereto he hath annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the promiſe of his own preſence. There is no acquaintance with him, without approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:135216:141"/>to him. <hi>Then ſhall we know if we follow on to know the Lord:</hi> Hoſ. 6.1, 2, 3. There muſt be no hiding then through guilt, among the trees of the garden. No turning away back, now that God hath opened thine ear. Thou muſt be like thoſe in the Prophet, <hi>They ſhall go and ſeek the Lord their God. They ſhall ask the way to Zion, with their faces thitherward, ſaying, come and let us joyn our ſelves to the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 3.8. Iſa. 50.5. Jer. 50.4, 5. <hi>Who is this that engageth his heart to approach unto me? ſaith the Lord.</hi> He requires it, <hi>Seek ye my face,</hi> and you muſt reſolve upon it, <hi>thy face Lord (I muſt and) I will ſeek.</hi> 'Tis good for you, and God hath annexed his ſpecial promiſe to to it: <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 73.28. (4) There muſt be an hearty conjunction with him. For of what avail is acquaintance, as long as the heart hangs looſe in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes? Your heart muſt be knit, and cleave unto him, as <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s did unto <hi>David: Pſal.</hi> 86.11. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.23. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1. What acquaintance with omniſcience, while your hearts ſtand off? and God is near in your mouth but far from your reins? <hi>Behold he deſireth truth in the inward parts. He ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart, and trieth the reins.</hi> And if thy heart be not right with him thy other appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations will be reckoned flattery, not friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.7, 36, 37. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. (5) Be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and often communicating thy ſelf to him. If you will hide your heart from him, what hopes of acquaintance with him? He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:135216:142"/>acquaintance ſhould be emptying and unboſoming his heart to him, and making him partaker of his ſecrets. Pour out your heart before him, then eſpecially in Prayers and Supplications. Preſent him your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes and concernments. Hide nothing from him, from whom indeed nothing is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Let all thy pangs of ſorrow have vent, like <hi>Hannahs</hi> in the pouring out of thy Soul. It may be when thou art pouring out thy caſe he may be pouring in his comforts: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 32.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 38.9. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15. Prayer hath the promiſe of his Preſence, and indeed of peace. <hi>In every thing by prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, let your requeſts be made known unto God. And the peace of God ſhall keep your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 145.18. Job 33.26. Phil. 4.6, 7. (6) Add to all this an affectionate correſpondence and communion with him. Acquaintance doth not barely note an intereſt in another, but inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, but endearedneſs, (at leaſt) intercourſe with that other. I would have you ſecure an intereſt in him, that thou be able with <hi>Thomas</hi> to ſay, <hi>My Lord and my God.</hi> This will ſerve thee in with choice peace, in that this God is the God of peace: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. But I would not have you think it enough to have obtain'd an intereſt in him, but you ſhould maintain an holy open inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him; for herein lieth the crop and confluence of Evangelical peace; and it is the end for which one whole Epiſtle was written: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3, 4. Oh! what a calm and ſerenity of Conſcience do ſuch holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:135216:142"/>of faith, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> breathe forth! What a conflux of joy are they bleſſed with! Who ever came down from this Mount, but his face ſhone with the irradiations of Divine love? Or did not ſay of being on this Mount as <hi>Peter</hi> of being on that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. <hi>'Tis good for us to be here, let us build Tabernacles, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 26.3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.29, 30. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36.7, 8.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.4.</p>

Adjure her throughout all her proceedings or argumentations, and articulate converſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it to be plain and full with thee, as ever thou wouldſt attain to a ſound and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled peace.

Let me only add, Thou muſt not expect as if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would, or could, witneſs peace to thee, before it hath wrought grace in thee. For its teſtifying peace to the Conſcience is by teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of thy grace, and cloſing with Chriſt. Thou muſt firſt ſet thy ſcal to the truth of God in the reception of his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony by faith in his Son, ere the Spirit of truth will ſeal thee up to the day of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.33. <hi>cum Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>In whom after that ye believed

               <p>Thus appealing Conſcience into, and adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her by the divine preſence will be of notable advantage. It will not only awaken and engage Conſcience, but will awe her from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, to which Sin and Satan may otherwiſe incline her, and put the more authority and undeniableneſs into her teſtimony and ſentence, as being given not only upon God's commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but with God's conteſtation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; and ſo will be the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to arreſt and ſtay ſcruples, to anticipate or anſwer Satan, and aſcertain the Soul in the ſweeteſt and ſteadieſt affiance, while the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and judgment of Conſcience to a mans righteouſneſs and reconciliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is after ſuch ſeverities, and as in the ſight of God.

Her entrance and firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces (its true) may promiſe a mellifluous ſweetneſs.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:135216:146"/>its worſt, and do implicitely condemn her, as ſhe doth explicitely condemn them. And how can ſhe in ſuch a circumſtance acquit and clear? Remember what it came to in <hi>Peter,</hi> how his bleſſed peace was exchanged into bitter pangs.

And he doth not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him in his goods, but accuſe him to his God. There is no impreſſion (it is true) can be made by him upon the God of peace, he is immutable; but there may be on the peace of God, for this is mutable in it ſelf, and in a mutable Subject: <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.19. <hi>c.</hi> 16.5.

Conſcience cannot lift up an hand againſt you, while he lifts up the light of his countenance upon you; and nothing but your ſins can hinder theſe ſhines. The Lord is with you while you are with him. <hi>Surely his ſalvation is nigh them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 4.6, <hi>cum</hi> 8.2 Chron. 15.2. Pſal. 85.9.

Yea, God aſſureth the true Evangelical obedience an happy tranquility and peace. The work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace.

               <p>Q. 8. <hi>Whether a pious Chriſtian may not live for ſome time without Peace of Conſcience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doubtleſs he may. For though we may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Piety to be the practical foundation of Peace; yet we muſt allow ſome time between laying the foundation and raiſing up the frame or building. 'Tis true, the end of that man is peace, but his entrance is moſt times perplex, as <hi>Manaſſebs, Ephraims,</hi> the Jews and Jaylors was: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.37. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, <hi>&amp;c. Jer.</hi> 31.18, <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 2.37, <hi>&amp;c. c.</hi> 16.29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is plain (1) there can be no peace before grace, <hi>Q.</hi> 1.) 'Tis firſt grace, then peace, in all the options of the Apoſtle: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. (2) There is and muſt be grace in order of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:135216:152"/>time and nature before peace. For the true peace of a gracious Chriſtian ariſeth from the teſtimony of Conſcience to the truth of his grace. So that Conſcience in pronouncing peace doth alway preſuppoſe grace, and maketh uſe of the truth of our grace, as a <hi>medium</hi> whereby it proveth that we are upon terms of peace: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.8. (3) There may be a conſiderable interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the implanting of grace in us, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting of peace to us, whether we conſider the ground of peace or the giver of peace. 1. The ground of peace. The immediate riſe of peace is not the ſimple exiſtence of grace in us, but the ſenſe and evidence of this grace to us. And it is manifeſt that grace may exiſt in that ſubject, which hath no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or ſenſe of it, and that for a long time. Witneſs <hi>Heman, David, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis one thing to know God, 'tis another to know that we know him. This is the product uſually of much time, many thoughts and trials of our ſelves. Chriſt tells his Diſciples, <hi>Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. But</hi> Thomas <hi>ſaith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goeſt, and how can we know the way?</hi> There is no contradiction. They knew it, but did not know that they knew it, notwithſtanding ſo long continuance with him. Science there was, at leaſt a dark and confuſed knowledg; but not Conſcience, no diſtinctneſs or clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of knowledg, though they had ſo long converſe with him, in whom were laid up the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.3,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:135216:152"/>9, 15. <hi>c.</hi> 42.3.—8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.4, 5. 2. Let the giver of peace be conſidered. Grace and peace are from the ſame Spirit. But not at the ſame time, or with the ſame circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 'Tis the ſame ſpirit that ſanctifieth us in the day of our renovation, and that ſealeth us up to the day of our redemption. But it is not by the ſame act. That is antecedaneous, this afterward. <hi>After ye believed ye were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that holy ſpirit of promiſe,</hi> Iſa. 32.15, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13, 16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. How long, or how little time he will take, ere the enſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the deed, is not for us to determine, while he hath not declared it in his word, and is pleaſed to diverſifie ſo much in his works. <hi>Pauls</hi> peace was not ſo early as <hi>Lydias</hi> was. 'Tis not for us to know the times and ſcaſons which the Father hath put in his own power: <hi>Act.</hi> 9.9, 17, 18. <hi>c.</hi> 16.14.1.7. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Grace is from the Spirit, as working out ſin, and writing out the ſimilitude of God upon the Soul. Peace is from him, as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with our ſpirits our Sonſhip and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that as he firſt worketh, then wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth; ſo there is uſually ſome diſtance of time, between this and that. And his witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that we are the Sons of God, doth ever preſuppoſe that work, as every act doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe its object: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16. Beſides, the Spirit doth not evidence or witneſs the truth of grace to us, but in and by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of grace, as it is at work in us. <hi>The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace, in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:135216:153"/>of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 15.13. Now as grace muſt be before it works, ſo the works and exerciſe of grace are ſeldom of that eminence as to amount to an evidence of the truth of grace till time hath given us ſome taſte and trial of them, in iterated and renewed acts. (4) A pious Chriſtian may live for a long time without peace of Conſcience then as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the premiſſes. Grace it ſelf is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inward and hidden man of the heart, and like the Souls in-being in the body, is not known <hi>à priori</hi> from its cauſes, but <hi>à poſteriori</hi> from its effects: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. Admit that theſe effects are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, yet are they not actually, and ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly diſcerned as to aſſure peace, without the concurrence of a twofold witneſs, God's Spirit and our Spirits. God's Spirit as being a moſt free agent, is not obliged to this, or that, or indeed to any time of ours. He blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where and when he liſteth. Our Spirits are often ſo dull'd, diſcompoſed, diſtempered with paſſions, prejudices, prevailing fears and ſorrows, or power of melancholy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they are diſenabled to diſcern, till theſe are worn out with time and experience. And mean while like <hi>Aſaph</hi> and others, the Soul oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time refuſeth to be comforted: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.35. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.15. (5) Hence there is no ſuch inſeparable connexion between grace and peace, as a man ſhould diſclaim grace, becauſe he is as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied peace. 'Tis a weighty ſaying of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſervant of God

               <p>Q. 9. <hi>Whether pious Chriſtians may not loſe the peace of their Conſcience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No doubt they may, if we underſtand it of peace it ſelf, though they cannot loſe the ſeeds of peace.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) They cannot loſe the ſeeds of peace, and in this ſenſe cannot loſe their peace: <hi>i.e.</hi> Seminally and radically conſidered. 'Tis a peace and aſſurance for ever, an everlaſting joy, <hi>a joy that no man taketh from you.</hi> For ever, not in regard of an uninterrupted continuance here; but in regard of its unintermitted cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. There is ever cauſe or matter of peace, though there is not ever the conſcience or mercy of peace: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>c.</hi> 35.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.22. 1. Chriſt our peace is the ſame ſtill, the ſame conſidered in himſelf, and as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummating of our Salvation. He will not loſe his intereſt in his Saints; and hath aſſured they ſhall not loſe their intereſt in himſelf. They may forfeit his ſmiles, but ſhall never fall from himſelf: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. <hi>c.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, 39. <hi>c.</hi> 10.28, 29. 2. The Covenant of peace is the ſame ſtill. 'Tis an everlaſting Covenant, and gives ground of everlaſting comfort. And the propriety of his Saints therein is everlaſting too, though they cannot ever plead it. They may not ever have the comforts of the Covenant, but they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:135216:154"/>be cut off or caſt out of Covenant: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8, 9, 10. <hi>c.</hi> 61.8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.40. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) They may loſe the ſweets of peace, yea peace it ſelf; God himſelf gives evidence to it. Remember how he ſpeaketh to and of his Church. <hi>O thou afflicted, toſſed with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, and not comforted. I called thee as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man forſaken and grieved in ſpirit. We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear and not of peace. I have taken away my peace from this people, even loving kindneſs and mercies. I was wroth and ſmote him, I hid me and was wroth, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 54.6, 11. Jer. 30.5. Iſa. 57.17. The godly have given us their experience in it too. <hi>Behold, for peace I had great bitterneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38.17. <hi>The arrows of the Almighty are within me,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>the poyſon whereof drinketh up my ſpirit. The terrors of God do ſet themſelves in aray againſt me. Mine hope hath he removed like a tree, he hath alſo kindled his wrath againſt me, and counteth me unto him as one of his enemies, &amp;c. He teareth me in his wrath, he gnaſheth upon me with his teeth, &amp;c.</hi> Job 6.4. <hi>c.</hi> 19.10, 11. <hi>c.</hi> 16.9. What ſhall I tell you of <hi>Heman,</hi> of <hi>Aſaph,</hi> or of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid?</hi> (who yet was of a ſanguine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chearful Conſtitution, and of ſingular skill both in Muſical inſtruments and ſinging) yet was his and their Souls full of troubles, and you may find them roaring by reaſon of the diſquietneſs of their hearts: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 88. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27. Peace it ſelf may be removed then, though the ſeeds of peace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:135216:154"/>In that thoſe ſeeds are now hidden from ſenſe, and they do not immediately bring forth the bleſſed fruits of peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intervening act and atteſtation of God's Spirit and ours (as was ſaid <hi>Q.</hi> 8.) without which a mans intereſt in Chriſt and the Covenant will be always dark, moſt times doubtful, and many times denied: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. <hi>c.</hi> 88.14. Now God's Spirit may and many times doth ſuſpend his teſtimony, and ſtand off as a ſtranger, or as a wayfaring man; yea, ſmite and wound, and write bitter things againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Soul. Our ſpirits may and do with-hold their witneſs many times alſo; either careleſs through oſcitancy, or confuſed in their obſervations, or complicated by other objects, or compreſſed in their own operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, through doubts which depreſs them, through diffidence which diſquiets them, through diſtracting cares and fears which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate them. So that our ſpirits may not only be oppoſite to peace, but overwhelmed with perplexities: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.26. <hi>Job.</hi> 13.26, 27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 77.2, 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 143.4.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Hence Chriſtians ſhould not meaſure their grace by their peace. Neither 1. as to the ſincerity of it. There is not any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible tye between them as that a man ſhould throw off all his hopes of grace, as ſoon as he is turn'd out of the hold of peace! Their tenure is different; Grace is a tenure for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity; but Peace is a tenancy at will, <hi>ad placitum domini.</hi> We hold both from God, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:135216:155"/>of meer grace or favour. But that we hold more abſolutely. God hath undertaken both parts of the Covenant, that we ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, as well as that he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us. This (ſee peace) we hold more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily, and are at our good behaviour in it. If we break his ſtatutes, he will break our comforts, though he will not break his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39, 40. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.31.—35. 2. Beſides, their tendency or reſpect is different. Grace appertaineth to the being of a Saint. Peace to his well-being. A man cannot be a Saint with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that; but he may be a Saint, (though ſad) without this. A man doth not ceaſe to be, becauſe he ceaſeth to be well. Sickneſs doth not unman us, though it unmirths us. 2. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we meaſure the ſtrength of grace by our ſweets of peace. <hi>David, Job, Aſaph, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> were moſt ſignal inſtances of the life of piety, as well as of the loſs of peace. They were not ſo much below others in this, but they were as much above them in that. The Scriptures do ſufficiently furniſh us with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the greateſt works of grace in the greateſt want of peace: <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17—25. But of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Q. 10. <hi>How may we recover Peace of Conſcience, which we have now loſt, eſpecially our Souls lying in ſo much diſtreſs and perplexity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Take up betimes, and ſuffer not
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:135216:155"/>theſe ſores to root deeper in thee, or run any longer upon thee. I ſay to thee as <hi>Jonathan</hi> to his lad, <hi>Make ſpeed, haſte, ſtay not.</hi> And as the voice to <hi>Paul, Make haſte, and get thee quickly out of Hieruſalem,</hi> out of this dark and deplorable condition. Haſten thy eſcape from the fearfulneſs and tremblings, thoſe windy ſtorms and tempeſts that now over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm thee: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.4,—9.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) To this end read over thy loſſes, and let this give life to renewed labours. Haſt thou not loſt the ſight of thy God? the ſweets of thy grace? the ſuavities of Scriptures and Ordinances? and the ſecurities and ſoul-ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions which thou wert wont to take in thy ſecret and ſolemn offices, and in the delicious views of thy ſanctified habits and faculties? And canſt thou lie ſtill under ſuch ſore loſſes? <hi>Job</hi> 9.11. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.81, 82.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Ruminate on thy condition, and let this quicken thee. Is it a condition only of loſs of thy dear peace? Nay, but a condition of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and deep perplexity. While it may be friends are bewailing, enemies are boaſting or blaſpheming, Satan is tempting, ſin is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and the thoughts of God are a terrour to thee. And is this a condition to be reſted in from day to day? <hi>Job</hi> 19.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20, 26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.3, 6. <hi>Job</hi> 30.15, 16.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Reflect on thy caſe yet more diſtinctly, and let this diſabuſe and excite thee. In all other troubles thou haſt thy ſelf to befriend
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:135216:156"/>thee. But in this caſe when Conſcience is ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and accuſing, thy ſelf will be engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, thine own Soul will diſquiet, and perhaps diſtract thee. Conſcience will call in all againſt thee; the Affections to awaken and arm their fears, cares, ſorrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to account and ſum up thy tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which trifled away thy joys, both in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in their circumſtances; thy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to aggravate both thy tranſgreſſions and troubles, and to anſwer whatſoever is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to reduce her to tranquility: <hi>Job</hi> 30.15, 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 55.4, 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 40.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="1">(1) Try the cauſe. Whatever be the cauſes from which, to be ſure ſin is the cauſe for which theſe ſad concuſſions are fallen upon thee. God afflicteth not willingly. 'Tis our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity doth (in a ſort) inforce him to it. Haſt thou not procured this unto thy ſelf? <hi>Yea, thy way and thy doings have procured theſe things unto thee, this is thy wickedneſs, becauſe it is bitter, becauſe it reacheth unto thine heart:</hi> Pſal. 38.3, 4.

This is not a time ſo much for whining over thy loſſes, as for winnowing off thy luſts; not ſo much for ſighing out thy complaints, as for ſearching out thy corruptions. The Church is not for

Yea, beg God to ſearch thee, and ſhew thee that ſin which hath made ſo ſad a breach.

Is not this the gall and the wormwood that moſt embitters this cup to thee! that the Lord hath forſaken thee, thy God hath forgotten thee? thy beloved hath withdrawn himſelf, and is gone from thee? Oh the felicities I have found in his favour! the overcoming ſweetneſs that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown me in his ſervice! <hi>&amp;c.

               <p n="1">(1) See that you apply his blood to you. The beſt Balſoms become ineffectual without a befitting application. Conſcience is the part affected, apply this plaiſter cloſe to it. <hi>You are not come to blackneſs and darkneſs, but to the blood of ſprinkling,</hi> Heb. 12.18, 24. Think
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:135216:161"/>it not enough that Chriſt's blood might be ſhed for you, but it muſt be ſprinkled on and by you. The remiſſion of your ſins both in it ſelf, and in the ſenſe of it, doth immediately flow from this, not that. We have ſinned, and ſo God is provoked. This is the burden and matter of pain to Conſcience. Chriſt is the propitiation for our ſins; this breatheth forth peace to Conſcience. But how is he the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins? Through faith in his blood. So that without an intervening act and application of faith, Conſcience is not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with peace notwithſtanding the blood of Chriſt: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. Come then and apply this choice and happy Balſom, <hi>the precious blood</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> calls it) <hi>of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. Apply, and bring down the vertue of it to thine own caſe and condition. Oh the advantages of an holy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication! which Chriſt aſſures us of, under the metaphor of drinking his blood: <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.54, 55, 56. Accept it then from the hands of thy dear Phyſician, who to ſave thy blood, hath ſhed his own, and hath waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood. Appropriate it eſpecially to the ulcerous and diſeaſed part. Take it for thine own. 'Tis no preſumption while the Phyſician tenders it to thee, and that freely; and tells thee thou muſt not ſo much as dream of life, without drinking his blood, (<hi>i.e.</hi> without applying and appropriating it), <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>c.</hi> 1.5. <hi>c.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37. <hi>c.</hi> 6.53.

And though the latter be only immediately produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of this peace; yet the former is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently preparative thereunto, and doth beget an initial and inchoative peace; at leaſt it will baffle many troubles. Go then as far with Conſcience as you can in it, in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her pleas from hence, if you cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord all in peace. Doth Conſcience ſuggeſt the foulneſs of thy ſins? ſpeak back again to Conſcience, His blood was ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins, yea and of my ſins; if I am but throughly willing to take him for my Lord and Saviour. Doth Conſcience tell thee of thy ſeveral forfeitures, and ſpiritual vaſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage to Divine juſtice? Tell Conſcience, his blood hath obtained eternal Redemption; yea there is redemption for me through his blood if I can receive and reſt upon him. Doth Conſcience terrifie thee with being an enemy to God, and God's being an enemy to thee? Tell her the blood of his Croſs hath made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the ſins of his people. And for me if I renounce my enmity, and return unto him: <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14, 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. Oh if Conſcience could but lay a clear claim to this blood, farewell ſuch cramps and convulſions quickly. Could ſhe but ſay, The blood of our Lord Jeſus was ſhed for me, I have redemption through his blood. Now there would be a moſt ample ſerenity. Well, Conſcience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Be it but admitted or granted (which hath been already aſſerted and made good) that a pious Chriſtian may loſe the Evidences of Grace, and may look upon himſelf as in the eſtate of nature, and I need ſay little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Propoſition that he may be in deep diſtreſs and paſſionate perplexities. Whether Conſcience be conſidered, or the concourſe of other cauſes to afflict him in ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Let Conſcience be conſidered. Your Conſcience was created with a capability of ſuſtaining the evils of ſenſe, as well as the evils of loſs. By her receptive capacity ſhe is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take in the impreſſions of both, and as well to let in the ſenſe of guilt and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery upon the perpetration of ſin, as the ſenſe of good and felicity upon perſeverance in ſanctity. By its active capacity it is diſpoſed to accuſe and condemn as well as to acquit and clear. Yea the activity of Conſcience doth much further the Chriſtians anguiſh, and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the ſword in the hand of Conſcience, and doubleth its ſtrokes; eſpecially while unbelie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> leaves the Conſcience deſtitute of the ſuccours ſhe ſhould receive from Chriſt and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without her; and lays her naked and deplorably ſubject to her own cutting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:135216:167"/>and killing aggravations of this eſtate without the leaſt reſiſtance from within her. Beſides the authority of Conſcience doth much heighten and haſten on ſuch ſelf-afflictions; while Conſcience is both law and plaintiff, and witneſs, and judg, and executioner, and all this from God. So that if the Soul would in this caſe make its appeal to him, Conſcience doth arreſt and ſtay it. Nay (ſaith ſhe) 'tis God that chargeth, God that condemneth you; I am but his mouth, his officer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it aggravateth and abetteth the ſadneſs of this Soul's eſtate; If I (that know or can recall ſo few things by you) if your heart condemn you God is greater than your heart, who knoweth all things. So that if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the pious may thus conclude of their eſtate (as hath been premiſed, to be without God and grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) the product muſt needs be calamitous. Diſtreſs of Conſcience is the deepeſt diſtreſs, the bones are dried by it; the ſpirit is broken by it. And <hi>Solomon</hi> puts it to requeſtion, <hi>Who can bear it?</hi> Prov. 17.22. <hi>c.</hi> 15.13. <hi>c.</hi> 18.14.</p>

Yea mans ſelf, which is in all other exigences his friend and advocate, now falls upon the naked Soul. Every power under the command of Conſcience cloſeth in with her part, to make the wounds thereof yet more wide and ghaſtly, and fetch out the fuller ſtreams of blood: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.3, 6, 7, 8. So then,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Pious Souls may not only loſe their peace but live in perplexities. Yea,</p>
               <p n="2">(2) When they look for peace, they may even then be laid hold on by perplexing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. <hi>When I looked for good then evil came unto me,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job), and when I waited for light there came darkneſs. My bowels boiled and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:135216:169"/>reſted not, the days of affliction prevented me.</hi> Your Souls may look up to God, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble. Yea, while you look for light, he may turn it into the ſhadow of death, and make it groſs darkneſs. You may look to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, godly men, yea godly Miniſters to take pity on you, but there is none, and to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to you, but you may find none; yea, they may ſmite and wound you, and take away your vail from you: <hi>Job</hi> 30.26, 27. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.19. <hi>c.</hi> 8.15. <hi>c.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20, 21. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.7.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) When they have but even now lived in peace, they may forthwith be arreſted by ſuch perplexing agonies. <hi>Behold for peace</hi> (or upon my peace, (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.6.) or after my peace, (as <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.31.) ſaith <hi>Hezekiah, I had great bitterneſs.

O how quickly may the ſcene of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and of God's countenance be changed! And that Sun ſet under a cloud, or ſuffer an eclipſe, which ſhone but a little ſince, with ſo much comfort and clearneſs! <hi>David</hi>'s moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was even now ſo ſtrong by divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that he ſaith, <hi>he ſhall never be moved.</hi> But forthwith God hides his face, and he was troubled.

               <p n="4">(4) Pious Souls may ſuffer many a change and paſſage, from peace of Conſcience to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of Conſcience, and from thence again to peace, and from this to perplexity. The God of peace is unchangable, but the peace of God is changable: ſubject to many changes. Conſcience it ſelf even when ſanctified is prone to viciſſitudes, and unevenneſs; or we had not been preſſed to keep it with all diligence; nor the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prayed God to unite and fix it. And if the power it ſelf be ſo variable; much more muſt the peace. <hi>Job, David, &amp;c.</hi> had their ſprings and falls, their ſummer and winter of this peace; (as the Texts already quoted make clear.) And theſe take turn; now this, then another. Saints are compared to Stars, which ſtand not always in the ſame ſite and poſture. 'Tis weeping at night, joy in the morning. And again, weeping in the morning, and joy at night; and perhaps ſometimes the Soul is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both day and night: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Job</hi> 14.20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.11. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 77.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 42.8. So that the gracious Soul may not give up his former peace for falſe and unſound, becauſe it is not fixed and ſteady. Even the Heavenly Bodies have their declinations and revolutions.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Pious Souls may be under ſuch piercing ſtrokes for a long tract of time. The ſhame of their tranſgreſſions, and the ſenſe and ſting of God's terrours may have afflicted them
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:135216:170"/>from their youth up. God may remove their Souls ſo far off from peace, that they may even forget proſperity, and with every breath they fetch they may be filled with bitterneſs. <hi>Surely againſt me is he turned, he turneth his hand againſt me all the day,</hi> ſaith the Church. Hence it is, you read ſo many pathetick and preſſing expoſtulations. <hi>How long, how long, how long ſhall I take counſel in my ſoul, having ſorrow in my heart daily? Pſal.</hi> 88.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.3, 17. <hi>c.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Job</hi> 9.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.1, 2. How long is a queſtion beyond my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to anſwer. Theſe godly men may ſeem to imply as it were meet only for God's own reſolution. This I may ſay for certain, thoſe diſtreſſes ſhall never bear a longer date than thy life doth. Death gives a perfect <hi>quietus eſt.</hi> Conſcience will be now perfected, and thy comforts will be perfected with it. The power ſhall be perfect, and the peace muſt be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perfect. Now ſhall your entry into peace be for ever perpetuated: <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.46. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10, 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. 2. God doth uſually diſmiſs theſe diſtreſſes before the death of the righteous. I remember not one inſtance upon Scripture-record to the contrary. But how many find we who lived perplexedly, to have died peaceably, and have aſcended with an heaven in their Conſcience, up to their Chriſt in the heavens? And who after all their ſore diſtreſſes have at length ſweetly ſung old <hi>Simeon</hi>'s <hi>Nunc dimittis, Lord now let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace;</hi> as <hi>Job, David, &amp;c.</hi> I do not ſay but a Saint may be
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:135216:170"/>ſticking in theſe deeps when death is ſent for him. For any thing I can ſee in the promiſes of Chriſt, the power of Conſcience, or in the properties and natures of this peace. <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to imply its poſſibility, while he is imploring mercy for the contrary in his own caſe. Nor are thoſe arguments to be unattended, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the pious have been wont to preſs God for peace in their prayers from death and the grave; as tacitly including, that they may be put upon that hazard without peace, unleſs he pleaſe to anticipate it of his grace: <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Job</hi> 10.20, 21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 88.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet ſuch is his indulgence, that he maketh but few inſtances of ſuch a pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſplicence, as his Children have to conflict, both with death and theſe diſtreſſes at once. We find <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (it's true) within a few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of death, and upon the brink of the grave, without peace, and in great bitterneſs. But God ſoon puts another cup into his hand, recalls him from the pit, and reſtores him to his peace: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.10.—20. 3. In this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate condition the godly may yet doubt, whether they ſhall ever be diſmiſſed from theſe diſtreſſes; their deſertion is ſo grievous, and diſtruſt ſo great. I ſhall go ſoftly all my years, in the bitterneſs of my ſoul. I ſhall go down to the grave without ſo much as any glimpſe more of my God, or of his grace. I am cut off. Lo, God hath overthrown me. He hath ſtript me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. He hath deſtroyed me on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, and I am gone; and mine hope hath
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:135216:171"/>he removed like a tree. Thus we find them caſting their eye inward, and crying out, Why is my pain perpetual? and my wound incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? yea upward, and complaining, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doſt thou forget us for ever? How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord for ever? Will the Lord caſt off for ever? will he be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.10, 11, 15. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.54. <hi>Job</hi> 19.6.9, 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.1.77.7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) The diſtreſſes of pious Souls may be of a large extent for quantity as well as of a long extent for continuance. Very extenſive in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and may extend over the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 1. In themſelves, they may be ſo large, as I cannot meditate any other ſtint or limit, than this, that they ſhall not extend unto a full and final deſpair. Otherwiſe they may, and often do exceed the ſenſe of others, and the ſpeech of them that are the ſad and ſuffering ſubjects. <hi>Job</hi>'s grief was very great, ſo great that words and weeping too were too narrow for the vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. <hi>Oh that my grief were throughly weighed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and my calamity laid in the balances together! For now it would be heavier than the ſand of the ſea, therefore my words are ſwallowed up.</hi> All language is too little to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their greatneſs, and therefore is a line too ſhort to limit or determine it; and yet neither ſilence nor ſpeech many times can mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate it. <hi>Though I ſpeak my grief is not aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and though I forbear what am I eaſed? Job</hi> 2.13. <hi>c.</hi> 6.2, 3. <hi>c.</hi> 16.6. 2. They extend
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:135216:171"/>ſometimes over the whole ſubject; all Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the immediate and proper ſubject, and over all under the power of Conſcience, the remote and leſs proper ſubject. Conſcience is ſometimes all in a combuſtion in the ſadded Chriſtian. <hi>My heart is like wax</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>melted in the midſt of my bowels.</hi> It fainteth, it faileth me; it is grieved, pained, ſore pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, within me, ſmitten and withered like graſs, oppreſſed, overwhelmed in me, diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, diſtracted; yea, my heart within me is deſolate. <hi>The troubles of my heart are inlarged, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 22.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 84.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 40.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 73.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 55.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 102.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 61.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 38.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 88.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 143.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.17.

               <p n="7">(7) The diſtreſſes of pious Souls may be very eminent for quality and degree, as well as for quantity and duration. I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to cleave an hair, to ſay thus far they may be intended, and no further. Though I doubt not to ſay, that theſe anxieties and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions can never bring them to an utter and univerſal averſation from God or godlineſs. Their diffidence and demeanor towards him may be very deplorable, yea dreadful; but their ſpot is the ſpot of children. They do not, they dare not ſay unto God depart from us, we deſire not the knowledg of thy ways. Yea, this is their greateſt deſire, that they were his and he theirs. Turn us again, O God,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:135216:172"/>and cauſe thy face to ſhine, is the burden of their prayers. And this is the greateſt thing they deplore, that they have turned away from him, and that he is turned againſt them. And could we trace their fears and dolors to their proper form, we ſhould find; they did not ſpring from an averſation to God or grace, but from an appreitation. That they drag ſo heavily, is not that they hate holineſs, but in that they have not holineſs (at leaſt) as to their ſenſe, or with that ſtrength and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they would fain have: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17,—23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1,—6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 80.3, 7, 14, 19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.21, 22. Nevertheleſs they may be deeply plunged in this ditch, and may arrive 1. To formidable conceptions of God; as if God were not only not kind, but cruel to them; as if he failed his promiſe, had forgotten to be gracious, and in anger ſhut up his tender mercies. As if he were not only deaf to their prayers, but diſtorted his providence, and did not do them juſtice, and were immovably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon their deſtructions. Such a feaver, or ſuch a frency rather, may theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes ſometimes draw upon the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. So that the Soul may not ſtick to ſay, <hi>I am troubled at his preſence; when I conſider, I am afraid of him,</hi> Job 30.21. Pſal. 77.8, 9. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.8. Job 19.7. <hi>c.</hi> 23.13, 15, 16. 2.

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:135216:173"/>and what profit ſhall I have if I be cleanſed from my ſin?</hi> Thinkeſt thou this to be right?

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:135216:173"/>upon Conſcience. 5. To frightful concluſions againſt themſelves. As if all paſt were but hypocriſie, all preſent were but iniquity, and all future were but excluſion from mercy, and enduring of miſery; as if it were not only paſt help but paſt hope. What is my ſtrength that I ſhould hope, ſaith this Soul with <hi>Job.</hi> Yea, where is now my hope? as for my hope who ſhall ſee it? <hi>My ſtrength and my hope is periſhed from the Lord. My Judgment is paſſed over from my God. My bones are dried up, my hope is loſt, and I am cut off for my part. I am counted with them that go down into the pit, like the ſlain that lie in the grave, whom God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth no more,</hi> Job 6.11. <hi>c.</hi> 17.15. Iſa. 40.27. Ezek. 37.11. Pſal. 88.4, 5. Upon ſuch precipices may the prejudices and paſſions of pious Souls hurry them. So that their Souls may refuſe comfort, as if they reſolved with <hi>Jacob</hi> to go down into the grave mourning, and to give the Sons of Conſolation but <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s language in another caſe, <hi>Look away from me, I will weep bitterly, labour not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me,</hi> Pſal. 77.2.

               <p>Let me only add, that though I have juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied theſe Propoſitions, I muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to juſtifie the paſſions and provocations inſtanced. I have not written this for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, but plucking up of ſin; nor for the ulcerating but healing of Souls; as alſo that others may hear and fear, that they fall not after the ſame examples of diſtruſt into the ſame exceſſes of diſquiet.</p>

                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:135216:174"/>Q. 12. <hi>What if a pious Soul hath hitherto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the uſe of ſuch means, and yet finds no peace, but his perplexities rather increaſe, what ſhall he do?</hi>

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Abide with perſeverance. Give not over but go on with the uſe of the means preſcribed thee; nor ſlacken thy diligence in the duties ſhewn thee. If they are means, they conduce to this end, and will be crowned with ſucceſs in the end. And if thou expect to come at the end it muſt be by a continued uſe of the means. Theſe are not wells without water, nor clouds without rain. They tend to peace in their native operation, and ſhall end in peace, according to God's ordinance and promiſe: <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.17. <hi>c.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.65. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.10. You ſay then you have not decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the means; but I doubt you have either declined from Chriſt in them, or in your care about them. Let me ask you 1. Hath there not been ſlightneſs in the courſe of your duties? You do the work of the Lord; but is it not negligently? How often do you quicken and convene all that is within you? How often do call upon your drowſie hearts? Awake, awake, <hi>Deborah;</hi> awake, awake to this holy duty. If you are ſlothful, no marvel, that God and Conſcience do ſtill ſcourge you; for you are herein guilty both of unkindneſs to God, and cruelty to your ſelves; for as much as every duty hath a reward in it for you as well as it is a debt to him: <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.10.

He is the rewarder of them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeek him. Their Souls ſhall delight themſelves in fatneſs: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. 2. Have not you ſlighted Chriſt in your duties? You come and that often, but do you come unto God by him? Do you take him with you in the hand of your faith, and in the arms of your love? No marvel if God be ſtrange to your Souls, if you are ſtrange to his Son. What atonement, what acceptance can you have, or hope for but by him? He is our peace: <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. Do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, from hence forwards. Keep him freſh before the eye of Conſcience; This may fill you with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Chriſt now undertakes the caſe, and that you ſhall in time have comfort. Bring him in your hand, and he beareth you upon his heart. And he cannot be denied who hath his father's ear, his father's heart: <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.22, 25. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.29, 30. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14.</p>

You have need of patience, of the patience of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, as well as of the patience of endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that after ye have done the will of God, you may receive the promiſes. I doubt your work is not done, or not well done. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there muſt be time allowed for, between work and wages, between ſeed-time and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:135216:175"/>In due ſeaſon you ſhall reap if you fain not: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. Durſt you ſay with that profane Purſevant of King <hi>Joram? This evil is of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> Nay rather ſhould you ſay with the Church, <hi>In the way of thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will we</hi> (ſaith ſhe, <hi>have we</hi>) <hi>wait for thee, who in the midſt of judgment remembreth mercy.</hi> Yea, and waits that he may be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his, (when it will be the beſt ſeaſon, when it will be beſt for their Souls), for the Lord is a God of judgment: 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. God will be known to be the God of all comfort, and of this arbitrarily; not at our but at his own pleaſure and appointment. He will ſpeak peace, and that in ſeaſon, in due ſeaſon, when it ſhall ſeem moſt free in him the giver, and when it ſhall be moſt fit for you the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers. But you muſt leave eternity to take his own time, and not look on it as if it would be at no time, becauſe it is not at your time. The viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak and not lie. Though it tarry, wait for it; becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry beyond God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, or your advantage: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.37. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.7. Be patient therefore; there is ſome peace even in patience; for it calms and ſtills the paſſions, and gives the ſoul the poſſeſſion of it ſelf; and 'tis ſeldom but peace enſueth on patience, for this hath the promiſe of it. <hi>I waited pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and

What though thy heart be caſt down there is no happineſs, nothing but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in hand? yet ſhouldſt thou charge thy Soul with <hi>David, Hope thou in God. Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him there is plenteous redemption. His compaſſions fail not, he hath corrected thee, but he hath not conſumed thee.</hi> And whence is this but of his mercy? <hi>This I recall to mind</hi> (ſaith the Church in her ſore and nigh ſinking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) <hi>therefore have I hope,</hi> Heb. 6.19. Pſal. 42.5, 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 130.7. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.21, 22. I grant your caſe is deplorable, but not deſperate. Your recovery is ardnous, but not impoſſible. Others have been reſtored, <hi>Job, David, Heman, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe feet were as faſt, yea faſter locked in theſe ſtocks than yours. If you make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, you'l meet with little, or no reaſon, to let your hopes flag and fail at this rate. Is there not the ſame way open ſtill? the ſame mercy in God? the ſame merit in Chriſt? the ſame miniſtration of the Covenant? Are you not as capable of peace now? when God hears you praying, crying, lamenting after him, and ſees you purſuing, panting after him, and preſſing on him, as you were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, when he heard little elſe (perhaps) than

You have loſt your aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, this is expired in lamentation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; but do not let go your adherence, this will end in life and happineſs at the laſt. God's end by putting you to feed on husks is not to keep you off, but to quicken you home to your father's houſe; not that your Souls ſhould drive further from him among the ſhelfs and ſands of deſpair, but draw nearer to him in the ſtill and ſafe waters of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:

You that fear him are called on to cleave unto him. And alas! whither can you go from him? and find the good and peace you look for. Thou mayſt call for thy lovers, but among all thy lovers there is none can comfort thee, while God is wounding and chaſtiſing thee. Is it not thy looſneſs and inconſiſtency with God, which hath brought thee into theſe laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths of confuſion, and mazes of perplexities? Call back thy Soul hither. Return unto thy reſt, O my Soul. My Soul wait thou only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God. And keep thy Soul here. For there is no quiet off the center. But every thing is quiet in its center.

I doubt your reſtleſneſs groweth out of irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. You are not throughly reſolved for God as your center and chiefeſt good. Or how is it that you are ſo eaſily carried from him? or cleave no more entirely to him? a ſtone needs not to be driven downward, nor fire upward; they affect their center, and acquieſce in it, nor are drawn from it, but by force and violence. Come then and gather up your reſolutions for God. Be ye ſtedfaſt and immovable. Yea, thou maiſt humbly tell him, I will not let thee go except thou bleſs

Be ſtill, and know that he is God; who cannot be conquered muſt not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of. Murmurings and complaints, as if he were rigorous, can never cure thee of thy wounds. Well may they cut them wider, and pierce them deeper, and make them ſmart with more anguiſh, and bleed in more abundance. 'Tis quietneſs under the hands of thy Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and confeſſing his righteouſneſs and thy rebellion that doth diſpoſe thee to a cure.

Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert juſtice? ſhall not the judg of all the earth do right? How long did he forbear you? How much hath he given if not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you. If deſert be urged he might have lain you ere this in the loweſt hell, and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you in eternal flames; for the wages of every ſin is no leſs than eternal death. So that his puniſhment is in no proportion to your deſert, but far leſs, far below it. Rather ſay, God is righteous, but I have rebelled. <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs belongeth to him, but to me confuſion of face, as at this day,</hi> Job 8.3. Gen. 18.25. Rom. 6.23.

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:135216:179"/>(I mean from murmuring aggravations, not from matter of action) is the moſt proper and pleaſant way to peace with God, and peace of Conſcience. Yea, quietneſs is not without ſome peace and ſedateneſs from unruly commotions, as its inſeparable companion. And now God doth by Souls as he doth by Ships. <hi>He maketh the ſtorm a calm, ſo that the waves thereof are ſtill. Then are they glad becauſe they be quiet; ſo he bringeth them unto their deſired haven,</hi> Pſal. 107.29, 30.</p>
               <p>Q. 14. <hi>What Conſiderations are there to quiet the heart in ſuch agonies and diſtreſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many, many ways. I ſhall preſent you ſome of them, and but ſome; which you may gather up from others, and from the ordinary effects, ends and operation of ſuch troubles on the pious.</p>

His infinite and immutable perfections have your Souls to feaſt with, and feed upon. Your ſtrength and your heart faileth you.

This I had prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in my eye, and let me pitch here a little; becauſe the pious Soul is apt to pore more upon their extremity, than to pry into their ends and effects; neglecting the bright ſide of the Cloud, and noting only the black and dark ſide. Conſider then, theſe ſharp throws and bitter agonies are not only to puniſh, but to purge, to prove, to approve, to improve, and to prepare his Saints for more ſignal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices or ſufferings. Of which you will ſee full proof in the further progreſs. Conſider then in theſe agonies,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Happily they are to purge me. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of judgment, and the ſpirit of burning is but to waſh away the filth of the Daughters of Sion. <hi>Like fullers ſope and a refiners fire, not to conſume but cleanſe and purifie them, to purge them as gold and ſilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteouſneſs. By this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged.</hi> And ſhall I quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at that pill, or caſt away that potion, which is bleſſed with ſuch a ſequel? becauſe 'tis bitter
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:135216:181"/>in it ſelf, or breaks my ſleep, or burdens my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whence it conſerves nature, and cures my diſeaſes, and the little pains I feel are preventive of far greater? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. Perhaps it is to purge, and ſo heal thy ſleepineſs and inanimadvertence. <hi>David</hi> lay in an apoplectick drowſineſs for a long time. This ſtate required ſtrong purgatives, and ſharp pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. God therefore applieth this medicine, and it effectually awakens and recovers him: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. Or perhaps it is to purge out pride and ſtiffneſs of ſpirit. And gentle potions will not do it, there muſt be ſome other draught, or the doſe muſt be doubled. <hi>David</hi> had enough to humble him, but his heart ſtood it out undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, till God put this cup of trembling into his hand; and this fetcheth all up, and his heart down, and his Soul-health returneth to its old frame, <hi>ibid.</hi> What ever it is this may quiet, that theſe troubles are not a ponyard to kill, but a purge to cure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Happily it is to prove me. <hi>Behold I will melt them and try them, for how ſhall I do for the daughter of my people?</hi> 'Tis not ſaid, I will burn them, and make an utter end of them. Let it be to a <hi>Judas,</hi> or a <hi>Cain,</hi> an evil, an only evil. But to a <hi>Job</hi> there is good as well as evil. Theſe troubles were for his probation rather than pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, not at all for his perdition. <hi>Thou O God haſt proved us, thou haſt tried us as ſilver is tried.</hi> God knoweth us perfectly and intuitively, but 'tis that we may upon trial know our ſelves, and be leſs ſtrangers to our own hearts, or that others may know us.

May not this quiet you? that whereas it might have been a milſtone to tear you, 'tis but a touch-ſtone to try you? to acquaint you more with your ſelves, and acquaint others more with your ſincerity. Why doth God ſuffer you to wander thus long in the Wilderneſs, but to numble you, and prove you, and to know what is in your hearts. God might have thrown you like brands into the fire, but he caſts you like Gold into the furnace.

But) <hi>That the trial of their faith being much more precious than of gold that periſheth, might be found unto praiſe, and honour, and glory,</hi> Job 23.10. 1 Pet. 1.6, 7. Perhaps it may be to approve you to others here; <hi>Job</hi> is to this day propounded for a pattern of patience to the faithful, and muſt pray for his three friends, as the perſon whom God would only accept. He became the more ſignally approved by being ſo ſtrangely afflicted. <hi>Paul</hi>'s neceſſities, diſtreſſes, afflictions, ſtripes, ſorrows did but commend him the more to the Churches of our Saviour. The skill of the Pilot is beſt ſpoken by ſtorms and tempeſts: <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Job</hi> 42.7, 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.—11. Or beyond a
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:135216:182"/>perhaps it is to approve you at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Chriſt, when he ſhall ſay, <hi>Lo, theſe are they that came out of great tribulations.</hi> That againſt hope believed in hope; that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhines nor ſtorms could diſſwade from my company, that would ſerve me, though it were for nought, and though I ſlew them yet would they truſt in me: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. And ſhould not this quiet thee? when theſe afflictions are but as the fining pot for ſilver, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace for gold, but to ſhew thy dignity, and the value men ſhould put upon thee, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the droſs and filth which hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by thee. Theſe bluſtring winds are but to blow off thoſe black clouds, which now overſhadow thee. Yet a little while, and the cenſures of <hi>Job</hi>'s friend will be blown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and he ſhall bring forth thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Happily 'tis to improve me. Theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are not ſo much to cauſe ſmart by his hand unto you as becauſe he hath ſet his heart upon you. He doth not chaſtiſe you for his pleaſure, but for your profit; that ye may be partakers of his holineſs, and they may yield you the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs.

If the bodies of the tree are ſplit, the boughs ſhred, 'tis to make the ſtem thrive in bigneſs, the top in breadth, and the fruit in beauty, of ſuch as are planted in God's orchard.

He ſeeth there is no ſuch bitterneſs as in leaving him, no ſuch bleſſedneſs as in living with him. This is the concluſion whereto theſe conflicts and compunction bring him. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> Pſal. 119.67, 68, 106, 107, 111, 112. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4.73.27, 28. How ſhould this quiet you, that God is hereby carrying on that part of your work and welfare, which is ſo much coveted by you? This file is but to fetch off the ruſt from your graces, and to furbiſh them for you. The ſame razor that ſhaves off your peace doth eſtabliſh your grace, and makes it grow both thicker and ſtronger.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to improve the peace of his people at the yonder end. It yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs to them that are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereby. <hi>Job</hi> had more inward peace as well as outward proſperity, after ſuch pangs and gripes; and ſo had <hi>David</hi> after his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, if you allow for God's anſwer to his deſires and prayers: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Job</hi> 42.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7, 8, 12.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Theſe troubles prepare a way to peace. 1. By breaking the Soul for ſin, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it for this bleſſed ſeed, and mellows the heart to an acceptance of it, and to afford her beſt manure to it. There is no ſowing upon fallow ground. God will not caſt away his ſeed among thorns and brambles. The more your heart is plowed and harrowed, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth the better harveſt: <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:135216:183"/>18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 126.5. 2. By bringing the Soul out of ner ſelf, and unbottoming her from all her falſe or friviolous foundations. Not a word can we now hear any more from <hi>Job</hi> in ſelf-juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are all in ſelf-judging, and ſelf-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring. This Soul is ſo frighted with daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the rock of her own righteouſneſs, that ſhe flieth it as a menſtruous cloth, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all her dependance upon the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15, 16. <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4.3. By bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toming the Soul upon a divine ſufficience. Hope thou in God, ſaith the Soul. Hitherto ſhe hath been like the Dove out of the Ark, fluttering up and down from one creature and courſe of life to another. But ſhe finds not where to reſt the ſole of her ſoot. The ſoul muſt have reſt; and finding none within, none without her, ſhe returns unto <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, unto God in Chriſt. She hath followed after her lovers, but they either fly from or frown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. And now ſhe ſaith, I will go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my firſt husband, for then was it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with me than now, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.5.</p>

               <p n="3">(3) Now it is, God doth uſually pour in joy and peace, as beſt magnifying his pity, his power, his promiſes, and plenteous mercies, to be thus ſeen in the Mount, and take an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of their extremities. His Cordials are for them in that they now faint. Now there is beauty for aſhes, the oyl of joy for mourning, and the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs. 'Tis time to ſuccour, now they are ready to ſink. Thou wilt ſave the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted people. The Lord will light my candle, the Lord my God will enlighten my darkneſs.

Now, how ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is it? like reviving eaſe after racking pangs, or the pleaſanteſt light after blackneſs of darkneſs. Now, how ſweet is it? ſweeter than the honey and the honey-comb, after ſuch draughts of aloes and rhubarb.

Experience tells her ſuch deeps are paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and a moſt delicious proſpect is of t'other ſide of the port.

               <p n="5">5. Happily this is to prepare me (may your Souls ſay) for ſome eminent uſe, and more than ordinary employment. Were you intended for the fire there needed no more than cutting down and cleaving up. Or were you for an ordinary place in God's building, it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have paſſed the Saw and the Ax; but now that God beſtoweth ſo much work upon you, 'tis an argument you muſt ſtand in a more conſpicuous place, and perhaps in the front of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:135216:185"/>the building. 'Tis obſervable, that whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God hath made inſtances of ſuch eminent diſtreſſes, he hath made them inſtances of as eminent uſefulneſs; as <hi>Job, David, Hezekiah, &amp;c.</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and <hi>Paul</hi> in the New, who was troubled on every ſide, within were fears as without were fightings: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. Thoſe metals are intended for a ſignal uſe, which are often caſt into the fire. Such exigencies do ſtock us with experiences. And experience gives wiſdom, enlargeth the underſtanding and receptive powers, and ſo enableth, yea enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth for the higheſt undertakings. 1. Perhaps it may be to prepare you for a paſſive ſtate, and make way to the condition and crown of Chriſts eminent Confeſſors, and glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. You that have felt greater will not fear ſuch leſſer evils. The world will ſeem little in your eyes to part with for God and his glory that could do nothing for you, when God was angry, and ſeems little or nothing to you, in compariſon with him appeaſed. We read of none in the New Teſtament that did equal <hi>Paul</hi> in thoſe inward fears, and he ſeems to excell all in inward fortitude. He that was moſt ſad did beſt and moſt ſuffer: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5.4.8, 9, 10, 11, 16, <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 20.24. <hi>c.</hi> 21.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.—28. 2. Perhaps it may be to prepare you for an active ſtate. 1. To be for eminent conduct in the Church, as <hi>Job, David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> were. God may intend you, not for paſſengers only to ſave your ſelves, but for Pilots to ſteer the Ship, and ſave others; who muſt be acquainted with the practice, as

Or perhaps for the eminent comfort of his choſen, that you may be able with <hi>Paul</hi> to comfort others in any trouble, with the ſame comforts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you were comforted of God. God may intend you for a monument of Conſolation, to the Chriſtians about you; and therefore hews and cuts you thus, that he may prepare and poliſh you for this excellent employment, and perſwade them to the entertainment of what you have experimented. I will tell you what he hath done for my Soul, is uſually an effectual argument: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.4.—8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 66.16. How ſhould this quiet you! The ax and the hammer are but to fit you for and faſten you to your place in the building. God hath ſome high ends by theſe hard exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies.

But there is alſo a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and perverſe deſpair, which driveth the Soul from that ſupream power and goodneſs, by which alone it can arrive to ſalvation and reſt. 'Tis of this that we are attempting the cure. Now this ariſeth out of a miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to themſelves, partly of their own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and principally of the object in and from whom, or the object by and through whom, they ſhould hope for Salvation, as if they were not able to beſtow it, or not willing.

Immoderate fears and ſorrows will but hide the ſuccours wherewith hope is wont to be ſuſtained from ſenſe, or betray them unto Satan. And like ſtrong winds to a ſtirring Sea, will make Conſcience riſe the more highly, and rave the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, and reject both the comforts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs which are brought her. What is my
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:135216:186"/>ſtrength that I ſhould hope? Do ye imagin to reprove words and the ſpeeches of one that is deſperate? <hi>Job</hi> 6.11, 26. Remember thou art a man that is put under the ducture of reaſon, and not under the power of brutiſh paſſions. The inſpiration of the Almighty hath given thee underſtanding. May not Reaſon ſay to thee as <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> (how much more may Religion ſay it?) <hi>If thou canſt anſwer me, ſet thy words in order before me, ſtand up,</hi> Job 32.8, <hi>c.</hi> 33.5. What cauſe is there for this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar? Why art thou ſo reſtleſs, O my Soul? why in this rage? Haſt thou not a God to run unto? Yea, hear him, <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, &amp;c.</hi> If, why art thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, O my Soul? cannot be anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bar of Reaſon, much leſs will this queſtion, Why art thou diſtracted, O my Soul? why art thou deſpairing? Let reaſon gird on her ſtrength for the battle, and hold the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in weighing thy condition, and how will thy paſſions flee before it, like the duſt before the wind? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5.</p>

This miſchief groweth out of the miſrepreſentation of us to our ſelves, in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it through a wrong <hi>medium.</hi> We look upon it through a red or flame-coloured glaſs, and ſo all things look to us as if they were all

Nay <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Heman</hi> we find daſhing upon this rock. He look'd upon himſelf as a man that had no ſtrength, free among the dead; as if he were enfranchiſed of the grave already; whereas he was in a ſtate of life, ſeeking and lamenting after God: <hi>Job</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.6, 7, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 18.4, 5. <hi>cum</hi> 1.2, 13. Is thy eſtate an eſtate of grace? the cure is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, Omnipotency is engaged for it: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16.—20. <hi>c.</hi> 40.27.—31.48.8, 9, 10. Is it the eſtate of nature? yet the cure is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Manaſſeh, Magdalen</hi> and others, whoſe ſins were more ſinful, whoſe ſtate was more ſad, have been actually cured. Haſt thou been a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, injurious? So was <hi>Paul,</hi> yet he obtained mercy, and for this cauſe, <hi>that he might be a pattern to them which ſhould hereafter believe,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13, 16. If thou wilt but yet return, though thou haſt been weary of God, and wearying of him hitherto, and made him to ſerve with thy ſins, yet he will return and ſave thee; not for thy ſake, but for
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:135216:187"/>his own ſake: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.22.—26. <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.22.—33. Is thy eſtate an eſtate of great diſcomfort? yet not of grievous deſpair, at leaſt in the root and reaſon of it. While life remaineth there is ſtill reaſon and room for hope. Say you, you have a name that you live? but you are like <hi>Sardis,</hi> in deed and truth dead, dead as to any ſpiritual life; yet <hi>Sardis</hi> is not ſhaken off. Behold, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel informs you, that the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God and live. Yea, it inviteth, inciteth, incourageth you. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.4. Rev. 3.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Joh. 5.25.

I know thou lookeſt upon him as clothed with righteouſneſs, and armed with omnipotent juſtice to revenge thy diſobedience. And 'tis true he is ſo if thou ſhalt perſiſt in thy ſins. But wilt thou revolve theſe few queſtions in thy heart, and return an anſwer to them in thy own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is not Omnipotent mercy as propenſe and willing to ſave thee, as Omnipotent ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is to damn thee? Have I any pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhould die, ſaith the Lord God; and not that he ſhould return from his ways and live? He doth not (ſo much as) afflict willingly. Judgment is his ſtrange work; but he rejoyceth to ſhew mercy. He is as it were drawn to acts of juſtice, but he delighteth in acts of mercy: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.41. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. Why then ſuch confuſion of heart? Why doſt thou caſt away thine hope? why ſhouldſt thou fear and fly from him as one that will not forgive, when there is forgiveneſs with him, that he may be feared? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is not Omnipotent mercy as prevalent with him to ſave thee, as juſtice is or can be to damn thee? Behold mercy rejoyceth againſt judgment. Acts of mercy flow freely from him, they are of his own meer will and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He hath mercy becauſe he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:135216:191"/>Acts of juſtice have their foundation ſtill without him, and are laid in the deſert of ſin. Juſtice requireth deſert. Mercy remitteth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and requireth only diſtreſs or defect, and knows no motive out of its own ſelf. Mercy doth not extend it ſelf upon any former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, or upon any future hopes. Its acts are all free, and both from and for it ſelf. How marvellous muſt the influence of mercy then be, that is not raiſed upon the goodneſs or worth of the ſinner, but upon the good will of himſelf! Yea, when juſtice ſeems ready to ſtrike, mercy ſtays its arm, and that for its own ſake, when there is nothing but miſery and neceſſity can be ſuggeſted for the ſinners ſake: <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15, 16. <hi>Job</hi> 37.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.38, 39. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.9. Behold then, the foulneſs and merit of thy ſins is ſupererogated by the freeneſs and ſuper-abundance of his mercies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hath not Omnipotent mercy provided and done more in order to thy Salvation then juſtice hath for thy damnation? Yea, he hath ſent his Son to ſave thee, if thou wilt accept of him; his ſervants by office to ſhew thee the way of Salvation if thou wilt attend them, his Scriptures and Ordinances to skill thee in, and work in thee the things that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Salvation, if thou wilt improve and obey them. And nothing can damn thee but thy impenitence in ſin. Hath juſtice done as much to fit thee for hell, as mercy hath to fit thee for heaven. Now the deſigns of all his acts of juſtice are but to drive thee to
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:135216:192"/>the acceptance of his mercies. If juſtice threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, 'tis that ſhe may not puniſh; or if ſhe puniſh here, 'tis that ſhe may not puniſh for ever. If thou art judged of the Lord, 'tis that thou mayſt not be condemned with the world: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.17. <hi>c.</hi> 13.26. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. Oh! turn thy amazing fears of juſtice, into admirings and hopes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hath not Omnipotent mercy hitherto preponderated the proceeds of juſtice toward you? Yea, 'tis not for want of might, but of meer will and mercy that he hath hitherto for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born you, and that your forfeited ſouls, ſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have not been fearfully ſnatcht from you, by ſome ſignal arreſt of divine vengeance. Hath he not indured you with much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering? Could finite mercies have put up a thouſandth part of ſuch continued injuries and indignities? What bowels, what bounties of mercies have yearned on you, and been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to you! why ſhould not Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect and ſay, may not the ſame mercy at laſt ſave me, that hath ſo long ſpared me? yea, and it will ſave you if you will yet ſhake off your ſins and ſubmit to its terms. Nay this is the very end of it (Oh may it ſo end in you!) Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the long-ſuffering of God is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the end and deſign of it. He waits that he may be gracious unto you. <hi>Return, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever,</hi> Rom. 9.22. <hi>c.</hi> 2.4. 2 Pet. 3.15.

                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:135216:192"/>5. Doth not Omnipotent mercy proffer and perſwade you to imbrace its Propoſitions of Salvation, and to prevent the ominous ſtrokes of provoked juſtice? yea, God will have all men to be ſaved. The grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Salvation to all men hath appeared. Lo, he proffers it to all. Whoſoever will, Ho, every one that thirſteth. He preſſeth it upon all, who ſoever thirſteth let him come, let him come, let him come. 'Tis urged yet a fourth time, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your ear and come to me. He perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. Here are waters, here is wine, here is milk, here is bread for you; whatſoever may raiſe your natures, or relieve your neceſſities. Here is the good which you ſeek after, and which alone can ſatisfie you. He prevents the exceptions, whereupon men ſtand off, its worth and their unworthineſs. Come, buy without money, and without price. He pleads and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates, <hi>wherefore will ye ſpend your money for that which is not bread? &amp;c. Why will ye die?</hi> Yea, he prayeth and entreateth by his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, <hi>as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you to be reconciled.</hi> Loſt man do but ſuffer me to ſave thee, poor ſinner ſuffer me to love thee.

               <p n="6">6. Hath Omnipotent juſtice ever condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any under the publication of the Goſpel, but upon the neglect or refuſal of the offers
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:135216:193"/>of Omniptent mercy? No mercy muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim you ere juſtice can damn you. Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive juſtice muſt have the permit (at leaſt) of divine mercy, ere it can ſo puniſh. This, this is the condemnation, the neglect of that great Salvation mercy ſhews us, the miſerable refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and abuſe of the riches of mercy. Mercy never refuſeth till men refuſe. What ſay you? are you willing to be at peace, and friends with that God, to whom you ſay, you have been ſo long enemies? Never were there any who were willing to accept the conditions of mercy, and to accord the quarrel of juſtice, that mercy hath abandoned, or juſtice arreſted, and caſt into hell-torments. If you are but willing, truly, throughly willing, be you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo weak, or have you been never ſo wicked, mercy hath a wing to cover you, and clucks after you as her chicken: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Once more, who are the Objects of Omnipotent mercy but ſuch as are in miſery? Mercy is an attribute whoſe aſpect is ever toward the Creature. God knoweth himſelf, loveth himſelf, but is not merciful to himſelf. And 'tis miſery is the object of mercy, as the ſole motive of beſtowing mercy is his own free mercy. So that the calamitouſneſs of thy condition ſhould not be abuſed to keep thee from mercy, but uſed as an argument rather to awaken and quicken thee to the ſpeedieſt cloſe with mercy. Here maiſt thou unload thy burdens, and eaſe thy miſerable breaſt. The
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:135216:193"/>Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy. With him is a multitude of tender mercies. Whither can you look but to mercy, if you will not ſtill live in miſery? Now here is work for ſaving mercy in the ſenſe of thy miſery. Juſtice looks what your merits are, but mercy looks what your miſeries are. Be not diſcouraged, ſin and miſery are the moſt ſtrong and ſuitable arguments whereby to plead for mercy. For now you preſent God with the proper object of mercy, which you pray him to magnifie. You have the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Worthies to encourage you. <hi>Lord, be merciful to me, heal my ſoul, for I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt thee.

               <head>CHAP. V. Queſt. <hi>Whether we ſhould direct our Prayers, only to God the Father? or may alſo to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt? And how may we order our thoughts aright, in diſtinguiſhing theſe three perſons, eſpecially as to prayer?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MOſt dear and worthy Friend, I willingly own the obligations you have put upon me, to God and you: And ſhall rejoyce to ſerve you, or if this may ſatisfie you, I ſhall not premiſe any needleſs Preface to what this paper offers you. Your conceſſions in our late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I ſhall not ſo much prove, as improve. The queſtion you would be clear in being complicate, I ſhall take aſunder, and tender you what ſatisfaction I may from the holy Scriptures, without the acceſſion of humane Authors; as knowing that your faith doth not indeed, ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>Whether we ſhould direct our prayers only to God the Father, or may alſo to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I affirm we may direct our Prayers to any of them, and ſhould direct our Prayers to all theſe three perſons, in the one moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and undivided Godhead. To this purpoſe pleaſe to peruſe theſe enſuing Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:135216:195"/>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. God is the object of prayer, the adequate and alone object. His commands (as alſo your conceſſions) determine our prayers to and upon him, who is God by nature, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and upon no other: <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 65.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.20, 21. So that the proper, fundamental and formal reaſon of divine worſhip is the perfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite excellency of the eternal Godhead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. The Godhead, which is and can be but one, there being but one firſt cauſe and laſt end: <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.4. <hi>c.</hi> 44.6, 8. ſubſiſts in Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, without any diviſion of that moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle eſſence; yet with diſtinction of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons. This (as your ſelf concedes, ſo) theſe Scriptures clear: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>c.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Jehovah, Elohim.</hi> So that as the Father is God: [<hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6. <hi>c</hi> 1.7.] So alſo is the Son: [1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.] And ſo likewiſe is the Holy Ghoſt: [<hi>Act.</hi> 5.3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>c.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8.] Three diſtinct perſons they are, but one and the ſame God. <hi>There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three</hi> (its not ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. agree in one, but) <hi>are one.</hi> Not only do they agree in one teſtimony, but are one in truth, one thing, one nature, one God: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. I ſhould further expatiate in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this truth, but that you have already evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced your clearneſs in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. The Son, and Holy Ghoſt being one God, co-equal and co-eſſential with the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:135216:195"/>Father, divine honour and our dues of office, as prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be deferred therefore, and given unto them, as well as to the Father. This is eminently enough pointed to us in that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer of <hi>Benediction</hi> which was preſcribed unto the Prieſts: [<hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23.—27.] Wherein they muſt thrice iterate, <hi>The Lord, the Lord, the Lord bleſs thee, &amp;c.</hi> But it is evidently and expreſly pattern'd in that prayer of <hi>Valediction,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>The grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God;</hi> i.e. the Father, <hi>and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all, Amen.</hi> The practice of <hi>John</hi> may be produced likewiſe in that proemial prayer for, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation of the Seven Churches: <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Grace be unto you, and peace from him, which is, and which was, and which is to come,</hi> (a frequent periphraſis of the Father) <hi>and from the Seven Spirits which are before his throne,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Holy Ghoſt, the variety and perfection of whoſe Graces in theſe Seven <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches is hereby indicated, he being but one and the ſelf-ſame ſpirit: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 11.) <hi>and from Jeſus Chriſt who is the faithful witneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Shall I need to ſubjoyn what you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps already ſenſe and conſider? That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is to be miniſtred in the name of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, as well as in the name of the Father: <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. God the Father then is not, cannot be ſo the object of prayer, as is excluſive ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God the Son, or of God the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>For the Son.</hi> It is manifeſt, that all men
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:135216:196"/>ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father, <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Father,</hi> Joh. 5.23. If you'l re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the laſt prayer of that lively Protomartyr <hi>Steven,</hi> it is directed hither, <hi>They ſtoned Steven, calling upon God, and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit,</hi> Act. 7.59. He that runs may read the ſame requeſts from the beloved Diſciple of Chriſt, and from his bride the Church, which conclude our Bibles, <hi>Come, come Lord Jeſus, &amp;c. Rev.</hi> 22.17, 20, 21. <hi>Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom,</hi> is the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded prayer of the penitent thief upon the Croſs: <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.42, 43. <hi>Paul</hi> begins (well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh) every Epiſtle with prayers to him, as well as to the Father: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is followed herein, both by <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. In ſhort, this is given us as the character of all true Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.14. <hi>With all that call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Obſerve, it is not ſaid, That call upon the name (of the Lord, through Jeſus Chriſt; though this is (no doubt) their duty, and his due, as being the Mediator. It lets us ſee, that his Saints look upon him not only as a middle perſon, through whom they pray unto God, but as true and very God, to whom they make their prayers.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>For the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> We are debters in point of prayer to him, as he alſo deriveth all our grace and peace to us. <hi>We are debters</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>not to the fleſh, but to the ſpirit;</hi> and this not only to live after the ſpirit, but
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:135216:196"/>to lift up our hearts with our hands to him, in ſpirit and truth. <hi>O come</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>let us worſhip and bow down, Let us kneel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord our maker; for he is our God, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 95.6, 7, 8. The Apoſtle maketh appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this part of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> External and internal worſhip is due then from us to God the Holy Ghoſt. The reaſon which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> gives us, reach him as well as the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>He is the Lord our God he made us, and not we our ſelves. The ſpirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the almighty hath given me life. The inſpiration of the almighty hath given me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> Job 33.4. <hi>c.</hi> 32.8. <hi>Know ye not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that your bodies are the temples of the holy ghoſt?</hi> Which he elſewhere maketh ſynonimous with being the temples of God. What then? <hi>Therefore glorifie God in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and in your ſpirits, which are Gods;</hi> and therefore glorifie God the Holy Ghoſt. So that inward and outward worſhip not only may, but muſt be given to the Holy Ghoſt: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. <hi>c.</hi> 3.16, 17. The Saints of God have offered him therefore their prayers of petition, (ſee inſtances <hi>Prop.</hi> 3.) and the Seraphims do offer him their prayers of praiſe and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, <hi>Crying holy, holy, holy Lord God almighty;</hi> which with expreſs warrant enough is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretable to the Holy Ghoſt, and not to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one, or both the other perſons: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.3, 9. with <hi>Act.</hi> 28.25, 26. Shall I add more evidence where there is ſo much already? Lo,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The objective fundamental and formal
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:135216:197"/>ground of prayer is found with the Son, and with the Holy Ghoſt, as well as with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Is the Father God? ſo is the Son. <hi>God over all, bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9.5. And the Holy Ghoſt is called God, not leſs than three times in one Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ampler teſtimonies, becauſe you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg this fundamental truth. Is the Father an omnipreſent majeſty, pray we where we will? ſo is the Son alſo. Hear him, <hi>Whereſoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> Mat. 18.20. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy ſpirit,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt? i.e.</hi> I can go no whither, but thy ſpirit is with me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. Is the Father an omnipotent mercy? pray we for what we will, he is able to hear and help us. So alſo is the Son, the mighty God, the almighty, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7, 8. And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the Holy Ghoſt. All theſe worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame ſpirit, dividing to every man as he will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. Briefly, is the Father omniſcient? knowing what we pray for, how we pray, what are the purpoſes of, and what principles are at act in our hearts, and in what proportion, and when it is beſt to anſwer our prayers, and to accommodate our deſires and diſtreſſes. So is the Son, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is in man, the very heart and reins, he knoweth all things, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>c.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. And ſo alſo is the Holy Ghoſt, he ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the object of faith. Is it the Father
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:135216:197"/>only? Nay ſo is God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt. And if the object of faith then of prayer alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. That the Son is the object of faith ſeems to require little or no proof with him that believes the Scriptures. Since they were written to this very end, that we might believe in the name of the Son of God, and that believing we might have life through his name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. And he that disbelieveth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth this, disbelieveth or denieth the Father alſo, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22, 23, 24. Here was the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> the rock, the bottom, or foundation upon which the Church is built, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16, 17, 18. Hitherto alſo our bleſſed Saviour calleth his. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me,</hi> Joh. 14.1. The Holy Ghoſt is the object of faith likewiſe. I believe in the Holy Ghoſt is one, and an eminent article of the true Creed of Chriſtians. Plain it is, that the wiſdom of the Spirit is the wiſdom of God, the power of the Spirit is the power of God, the teſtimony of the Spirit is the teſtimony of God. And if we may and ſhould believe the witneſs of men, much more the witneſs of God, for the witneſs of God is greater. It is the Spirit (who is one God with the Father and with the Son) that beareth witneſs, becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is truth; and therefore to be believed relied upon as the Apoſtle argueth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6, 7, 9. He that believeth not in the Spirit then believeth not in God. He that tells a lie to the Spirit tells a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:135216:198"/>being verily and truly Gods, and being diſtinct perſons in the one only and ſame Godhead; we may then (according to the grounds laid) direct our prayers to God with expreſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one only, or of more, or of all the perſons in the Godhead. The laudable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Scripture may evince the lawfulneſs hereof. <hi>Paul</hi> directs his prayers with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mention ſometimes but of one perſon, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.14.

                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt being but one only God, of one nature, mind, will, power, Godhead, they are therefore (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt Propoſition) to ſpeak ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly, but one only formal object of prayer, and of other parts of religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. So that our Saviour bids us baptize (not in the names but) in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. Not only to intimate their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality in power and authority among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as being one and the ſame God, with whom are no degrees of power or perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But to inſtruct us how we ſhould conſider of, and come before them in that, and in all other acts of worſhip upon the ſame reaſon, as thoſe that are co-eſſential, and co-equally the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:135216:198"/>original and object of all (as natural, ſo) inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted worſhip. Thus alſo were the Prieſts bound to ſay in bleſſing the people, <hi>Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah bleſs thee, &amp;c.</hi> Num. 6.24, 25, 26. Thereby pointing them and us; That though they are diſtinguiſhed in their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſubſiſtence; yet they are not to be divided in our prayers and ſupplications. Rather that as theſe three are one in the unity of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſence, ſo they ſhould be eyed as one in the unity of an end or object in all our devout and religious exerciſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. In directing prayer therefore to God with expreſs mention but of one or two perſons, the Saints of old did not, and our ſelves ought not to exclude the other perſon or perſons, becauſe they are all one God, co-equal and co-eternal, co-exiſting with each other, yea in each other, in the ſame Godhead. <hi>Believe me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that I am in the Father, and the Father in me,</hi> Joh. 14.11. You need not any proofs from me, that the Godhead or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature and excellency is the formal and adequate ground and reaſon of divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Or that theſe three perſons are God, and therefore equal in the Godhead, equal in glory; not one greater or leſs than another, not one above or below another. Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes being of infallible verity, the inference is plain and obvious, therefore are they to be equally worſhipped; not one more or leſs than another, not one above or beneath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. For there being no difference or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the ground and adequate reaſon of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:135216:199"/>the divine Worſhip that is due unto them, there can be no difference or degrees admittable with any ground or reaſon in the worſhip that is done unto them. If one be not leſs a God than another, one may not be leſs glorified than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>

                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 8. Yet laſtly, the Father being the fountain and firſt principle (though not of their eſſential ſubſiſtence, yet) of the perſonal ſubſiſtence of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, (of which in the next Queſtion) and ſo of their peculiar manner of working <hi>ad extra,</hi> or without the Godhead, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Son working from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt from them both.) The Saints therefore have, and your ſelves may eminently (though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively) direct your prayers to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yea, and that for thoſe benefits which come to you, by the more eſpecial and eminent operation of God the Son, or of God the Holy Ghoſt. 'Tis eaſie to inſtance. <hi>Paul</hi> bleſſeth the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for all the bleſſings in and by Chriſt, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his ſins, the redemption of his ſoul, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>Q. 2. <hi>How may we order our thoughts aright in diſtinguiſhing theſe three perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am not willing to weary either my ſelf or you with a needleſs diſcuſſion of what you intend by this expreſſion, <hi>order your thoughts aright.</hi> I ſuppoſe you would not have me underſtand thoughts ſo much in their larger and leſs proper notion and acceptation, (as they include all the interior acts of the Soul) as in their more limited, ſtrict and proper ſenſe, as they import the acts and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the intellect. And that your meaning is how you may order your apprehenſions (or more briefly may apprehend) aright in or touching the diſtinction of thoſe perſons. And truth is according as your thoughts are well or ill ordered in this ſtrict ſenſe, that your apprehenſions are either fitting or faulty, ſo will your thoughts be in that larger ſenſe; all the other inward motions of your Soul with relation hereunto, will be well or ill ordered, more free or more faulty. This only I ſhall therefore further premiſe.</p>
               <p>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are and may be preſented to our thoughts under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſideration. 1. Common or eſſential, as they are God. 2. Peculiar or perſonal as
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:135216:200"/>they are perſons in the Godhead. And this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of them is either 1. More abſolute, as they all ſubſiſt in the unity of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Or 2. Meerly relative in the order of one perſon to another, and diſtinction of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from another. And now in accord to your deſires, I offer you theſe Directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Think of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as divine and increated perſons. That they are perſons I do not attempt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm becauſe you already confeſs both thing and name, as that which beſt agreeth to the Scripture-expreſſion, as it doth <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. 'Tis true, that this term perſon doth import the moſt excellent kind of ſubſiſtence, <hi>viz.</hi> intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and rational. (We call not the beſt of brutes a perſon). But in that this term is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Creatures, to Men, to Angels; you are to think of Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt as increated perſons, from whom therefore you muſt remove all creature-imperfections, even in your very thoughts. As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Created perſons are of a determined, or rather finite nature. 1. Of finite perfections, 2. of a finite preſence, 3. of finite power, and 4. of a finite permanence or duration. But theſe increated perſons are infinite in their nature, the Godhead being infinite. 1. Of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfections. <hi>Touching the Almighty we cannot find him out,</hi> Job 37.23. <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God? Canſt thou find out the Almighty to perfection? It is as high as heaven, what canſt thou do? deeper than hell, what canſt thou know? &amp;c.</hi> Job. 11.7, 8, 9. 2. Of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:135216:200"/>preſence. <hi>Do not I fill heaven and earth? ſaith the Lord. Yea, bleſſed Lord, whither ſhall I go from thy ſpirit? or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence? Jerem.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Of an infinite power. <hi>I am God almighty,</hi> ſaith he. <hi>Is any thing too hard for me? &amp;c. Gen.</hi> 35.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.27. 4. Of an infinite permanence or duration. <hi>From ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting thou art God. He is the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity,</hi> Pſal. 90.2. Iſa. 57.15.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Created perſons are of a diviſible and compounded nature, and therefore changable. But theſe increated perſons are of a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible, ſimple and immutable nature. For ſo is the Godhead, a moſt pure, a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nature, without the leaſt change, without the leaſt compoſition. Each perſon is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who is what he is; <hi>viz.</hi> a moſt pure and perfect being; without variableneſs, or ſo much as a ſhadow of turning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.5.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Created perſons are of a dependent nature. As all created perſons depend upon their firſt cauſe or principles for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued preſervation; ſo the nature doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon its proper perſon, for its ſupport or ſuſtentation. But now the divine nature, which is in theſe three perſons, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon any or upon all theſe perſons for its ſuſtentation or ſubſiſtence. But all three perſons ſubſiſt in this one independent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is ſaid of the ſubſiſtence of the Son, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſubſiſting in the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:135216:201"/>form, <hi>i.e.</hi> in the eſſential form of God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal with God, as it follows. The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it ſelf is independent, or it is not God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or it is not infinite. He is <hi>Jehovah:</hi> which implys that his being is neither from, nor for, nor in, nor by any other, but is moſt abſolute and independent. <hi>I am the firſt, and I am the laſt, and beſide me there is no God,</hi> Iſa. 44.6. <hi>c.</hi> 45.21, 22.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Created perſons are of different natures; numerically different, though not ſpecifically. True it is, that <hi>Peter, Paul, Philip,</hi> are of the ſame ſpecifical nature; <hi>i.e.</hi> they are all of them men; but they are not of the ſame ſingular or numerical nature; <hi>i.e.</hi> they are not the ſame man. But theſe increated perſons are of the ſame nature, not only of the ſame ſpecifical, but of the ſame ſingular nature; they are the ſame God. That as you may ſafely ſay, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt: So you muſt think and ſay of them, that they are one and the ſame God, one and but one. <hi>Theſe three are one,</hi> 1 Joh, 5.7. <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord our God,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>is one Lord.</hi> You muſt not then think of theſe three uncreated perſons, as you would of thoſe three created, as if theſe were diſtinct Gods, as thoſe are diſtinct men.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Created perſons have many different accidents, and are diſtinguiſhed from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a congeries or heap of accidents, as time, place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe increated perſons are of that infinite perfection, as being the ſame God, that they are above any ſuch thing
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:135216:201"/>as an accident. The infinite ſimplicity of the Divine nature cannot admit of ſuch finite things as are accidents, as alſo nor can its immutability. 'Tis a confeſſed maxim amongſt Chriſtians, <hi>Whatſoever is in God is God. I have ſworn by my holineſs,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.35. <hi>God ſware by himſelf,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13. God's Holineſs then is God himſelf. 'Tis true the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by their perſonal properties; or if you will needs ſo call it by their perſonal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes. But they are not different by any perſonal accidents, as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are. This their perfect nature is utterly alien from, and abhorrent of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Think of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as the ſame God, ſubſiſting in one and the ſame undivided eſſence or Godhead. See that you do not divide the nature when you diſtinguiſh the perſons. Therefore <hi>John</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhewn you theſe three diſtinct perſons, immediately ſubjoyneth that they have but one undivided eſſence, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. The ſame in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect doth Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. as we have noted before, <hi>Q.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. Enough may ſeem to have been already ſpoken to this, both there, and but even now. But I add, you ſhould not only think of them as one and the ſame God, in the ſame moſt ſingle eſſence, but think of them as inſeparably ſubſiſting in and with one another, in the unity of this ſame eſſence. That the Son ſubſiſts in the Divine nature or eſſence you ſaw but even now from <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. That the Son and Father ſubſiſt in the ſame Divine
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:135216:202"/>eſſence is manifeſt, in that the Son is the expreſs, image of his Fathers perſon or ſubſiſtence, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and his Father and he are one in eſſence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30. The Holy Ghoſt therefore muſt and doth ſubſiſt in the ſame eſſence; for he is one God, with the Son and Father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Believeſt thou not, ſaith Chriſt to Philip, that I am in the Father, and the father in me?</hi> And then he calleth upon him from his word and from his works, which were the Fathers in and with him. <hi>Believe me, that I am in the father, and the father in me, Joh.</hi> 14.10. And again afterward, he aſſureth his Diſciples, <hi>That at that day</hi> (when the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter ſhould be more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully communicated to them from the Father at that day) <hi>ye ſhall know that I am in the father,</hi> ver. 20. Now the Holy Ghoſt being co-eſſential with the Father, and with the Son, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting with them in the ſame ſingle and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent nature, doth therefore alſo ſubſiſt in and with the Father and Son, and they alſo in and with the Spirit. In ſhort then, you muſt ſo think of them that you do not divide when you do diſtinguiſh them. 1. Think of them as whoſe eſſential attributes are undivided. That the Son and Holy Ghoſt are equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, infinite, immutable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with God the Father, becauſe God equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And there can be no inequality betwixt them who are all infinite, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. 2. Think of them as whoſe eſſential actions are undivided. That whatſoever the Father doth as God (I ſay not as a perſon in the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:135216:202"/>Godhead) the ſame doth the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt likewiſe, as in creating the world, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the dead, <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Job</hi> 33.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Think of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as three diſtinct perſons in the undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Godhead. Let your thoughts work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of truth. Read that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Scripture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. Lo, how they are diſtinguiſhed by their names, <hi>the Father, the Word,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>and the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> diſtinguiſhed by number, three, theſe three that are one; one God, of one nature. Remember the Baptiſm of your Saviour. There might you have heard the Father owning the Son, and have ſeen the Son, who had taken our fleſh, with the heavens opened to him by the Father, and have beheld the Spirit deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the Son like a Dove from the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16, 17. Reflect elſe on your own Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as it is required by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. Here their ſeveral diſtinct names are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and their ſingular or Divine nature pointed at. Recall elſe if you will that beloved Sermon of our Mediator, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. He doth more than once deliver you their diſtinction; diſtinguiſhing the Father from himſelf, and the Spirit from them both. <hi>The Father will ſend the Holy Ghoſt in my name,</hi> ver. 26. <hi>I will pray the Father and he ſhall give you another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, even the ſpirit of truth,</hi> ver. 16, 17. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other from himſelf, who (as to his corporal preſence) was going from them; another from the Father, <hi>Who</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>ſhall give you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:135216:203"/>comforter.</hi> But how another? Another God? It is impoſſible. Another perſon is only intelligible. So then you muſt think of Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, not as diſtinct Gods, but as diſtinct perſons in the Godhead; as one and the ſame God, but not as one and the ſame perſon. Think of the Father as not being the Son; or the Son as not being the Father; on the Holy Ghoſt as being neither Father nor Son; and upon the Father and Son as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Ghoſt. Look upon them as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, and therefore as diſtinct. It being moſt abſurd to ſay, that the ſame perſon is equal to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Think of them as diſtinguiſhed in and by the perſonal and incommunicable actions. The Father begets the Son, and hath given the Son to have life in himſelf as the Father hath life in himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. The unbegotten Father then is clearly diſtinguiſhed from the only begotten Son, and the Son alſo from the Father. The Father and Son do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Holy Ghoſt by an eternal ſpiration, or communicating to him his diſtinct ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Divine Eſſence. The holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſpeak of the holy Spirit as ſent by and from both the Father and the Son, and as receiving from the Son as well as from the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>c.</hi> 15.26. <hi>c.</hi> 16.14, 15. As the Spirit both of the Son, and of the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. So that the Father and Son ſending are, and muſt be diſtinguiſhed from the Spirit ſent. No one ſends himſelf, or to himſelf, <hi>Joh. ibid. &amp;c.</hi> 14.16, 17. Nor doth
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:135216:203"/>the Scripture mention the Holy Ghoſt as the power only of the Godhead, but as a perſon in the Godhead. 'Tis not ſaid <hi>it,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> ſhall lead you, <hi>he</hi> ſhall glorifie me; the Comforter <hi>whom</hi> the Father will ſend. It is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">(2) Think of them as diſtinguiſhed in and by their perſonal and incommunicable proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 'Tis proper to the Father to beget the Son; to the Son, to be begotten of the Father; to the Holy Ghoſt to proceed both from the Father and the Son. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. Theſe diſtinct incommunicable properties infer plainly the diſtinction of the perſons. The Son begotten cannot be the Father begetting. And the ſpirit proceeding cannot be either Father or Son, from whom he doth proceed.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Think of them as diſtinguiſhed in and by the principle, original and order of their perſonal exiſtence. The perſonal ſubſiſtence of the Father is from himſelf; <hi>i.e.</hi> he receives ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence from no other without himſelf, but is the principle of ſubſiſting to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. <hi>c.</hi> 14.26. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſubſiſtence of the Son is from the Father, <hi>I live by the Father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I came forth from the Father,</hi> Joh. 6.57. <hi>c.</hi> 16.28. The perſonal ſubliſtence of the Holy Ghoſt is both from Father and Son; from whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and by whom he is ſent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. <hi>c.</hi> 16.14, 15.</p>

                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:135216:204"/>(4) Think of them as diſtinguiſhed in and by the principle, original and order of their operations and actions, which are terminated without the Godhead. The order of working follows that of being. As their eſſential being is undivided, ſo are their external works un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided alſo. You know the received rule, <hi>Opera trinitatis ad extra ſunt indiviſa.</hi> As Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wrought in us, both by God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>c.</hi> 6.11. As their perſonal being or ſubſiſtence is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in the ſame order are their works alſo diſtinguiſhed. Is the Father of himſelf? ſo he worketh of himſelf. <hi>The Father of whom are all things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26, 27. Is the Son of and from the Father? ſo he worketh of and from the Father, <hi>I have not ſpoken</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of my ſelf; I do nothing of my ſelf but as my Father hath taught me, &amp;c. The Son can do nothing of himſelf but what he ſeeth the Father do, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 12.49. <hi>c.</hi> 8.28. <hi>c.</hi> 5.19, 20. Is the ſpirit both from Father and Son?

               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. Think of Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt as diſtinguiſhed, not only in but from the Divine eſſence. Though it be true, they are not eſſentially diſtinguiſhed, yet it is alſo
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:135216:204"/>true, that they are diſtinguiſhed from the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghoſt is God; theſe three are one God. Yet, though the Godhead be predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of all the three perſons, the perſons in the Godhead are not predicated of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Father is not the Son, nor is the Son the Father, nor is the Holy Ghoſt either Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Son, or either of thoſe the Holy Ghoſt. The divine eſſence doth not beget, nor is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, nor doth proceed; which the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſimplicity and immutability thereof can no way admit. Yet the Father doth beget, the Son is begotten, and the Holy Ghoſt doth proceed. Think of the Divine eſſence then. 1. As one, only one, moſt ſingly and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly one. But think of the Divine perſons as three, three diſtinct ſubſiſtents in this Divine eſſence. 2. Think of the Divine eſſence as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of and from it ſelf; but think of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perſon of the Son as of or from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Holy Ghoſt as from them both. 3. Think of the Divine eſſence as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or communicated to all, and to each of the three perſons. But of the perſons as incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, and impredicable of one another. The Father cannot be the Son, nor the Son the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. The Divine eſſence (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude) is of abſolute conſideration, a perſon is of relative conſideration. A perſon (in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof) includeth, over and above the eſſence, a relation, as of the Father to the Son, of the Son to the Father, of both to the Holy Ghoſt, and of the Holy Ghoſt to both. A perſon
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:135216:205"/>in the Godhead is the Godhead diſtinguiſhed by an incommunicable relative property. Theſe things have received proof already; therefore I forbear here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 5. Think of this Trinity of perſons, in the unity of the ſame eſſence, not only with diſtinct apprehenſions, but with deareſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretiations, with deepeſt abaſements of thy ſelf with divineſt admiration of them, with devotedſt adheſion, with deliciouſeſt affections, and with devouteſt actions.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) With deareſt appretiations. The top of your bleſſedneſs or felicity is union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with this bleſſed Trin-unity. Let your higheſt thoughts turn in hither, and take up here. Prefer one God in three perſons beyond all other good, and price him as your higheſt and only chief good. The glorifying and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of theſe three glorious perſons in the one glorious Godhead is the buſineſs and bleſſedneſs of the glorified ones, to all eternity as is (not obſcurely) intimated, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8.—<hi>Holy, holy, holy Lord God almighty.</hi> Let this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery therefore have the higheſt throne in all the thoughts of your mind.

How much more ſhould we that dwell in Houſes of Clay! Here, if ever; ſhould reaſon lower its Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail, and ſtrike or ſtoop rather to Revelation. Fleſh and Blood cannot reveal, nor doth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit of faith receive this myſterious union of three perſons in one nature; or that other, of two natures in one perſon, one Chriſt. Though theſe are not againſt, yet are they above reaſon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11, 12, 14. But if reaſon it ſelf call for <hi>Elijahs</hi> Mantle wherein to wrap its face from this dazling glory: what are our Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions! our Sins! what malignity is in them! and what murmuring ſhould be by us! while every ſin is a dart thrown at this glorious Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and as it were a ſtudy of diſſolving the ſubſtantial union of theſe three glorious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtents.

This is that which crucified the Son, quencheth the Spirit, and puts contempt upon the Father. Once more your very relation to ſo high a God ſhould humble you: Let my ſoul boaſt it ſelf in him; but bluſh and be aſhamed in me, who

God the Father begetting God the Son, and yet the Godhead of the Son unbegotten! God the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from both, and yet the Holy Ghoſt God Coeternal and Coequall with both! All theſe one God in each other! <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius &amp; alius,</hi> yet not <hi>Aliud &amp; aliud!</hi> theſe are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I find beyond my reaſon to comprehend, 'tis too ſhort to reach them, yet find reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs &amp; believe, becauſe God hath revealed them.

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:135216:206"/>of the Holy Ghoſt! And let my reaſon never cavil at that which is infinite, but remember continually that it ſelf is finite! There are fewer difficulties in that than in this ſubject, where the Apoſtle falls off from a ſtrickt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, and falls into a devout admiration, O the depth!

How can you otherwiſe chooſe than be pleaſed with theſe undivided perſons, who are to you an undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided portion, and an eternal bleſſedneſs? Is there any ſuch garden of delights and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as in contemplating the divine perſons and perfections, eſpecially as they are yours in ſo near and dear a relation? Where is your love? where is more lovelineſs? If you have any thoughts to lay out in love, here beſtow them, who can never beſtow them elſe-where with more comfort, or with better cauſe. In the Godhead, lo the perfections of love. Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely loving is too low an expreſſion for him, he is infinite love, <hi>for God is love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8. In each perſon, lo the prints of love. <hi>The Father hath ſo loved you, as to give his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son to you,</hi> ver. 9.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>The Son hath ſo loved you, as to give himſelf for you and to make a Bath of his own blood to waſh you, Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5.

Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. <hi>Rom</hi> 5.5. How can you think of ſuch united loves, and not be wrapt up into extaſies of love for them, that are ſo loving and ſo lovely!</p>
               <p n="6">(6) With devouteſt actions. The union of theſe three glorious perſons, in the one glorious
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:135216:207"/>Godhead calls for the united power, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of all your graces. Every Saint ſhould be a <hi>Seraphim,</hi> when he cometh to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate this myſtery of myſteries, in regard of the fervour and vigour of each renewed facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and quality.

Now for the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faith, love, hope, &amp;c. to give glory to God, for of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſay ſome, (<hi>Aug. de Trin. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>Lomt. ſent. l.</hi> 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 36.) of the Father, through the Son and for the Spirit, <hi>Alleluja, Alleluja, Alleluja,</hi> to theſe three glorious perſons, and again, <hi>Amen Alleluja,</hi> to the one only Eternal God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head! to allude to <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.1, 3, 4, 6. <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> A doxology of great antiquity, and of as great authority.</p>
               <p>Thus may your thoughts walk freely, and work effectually, powerfully, practically upon this moſt worthy ſubject. I adviſe you not ſo much to ſpeculative thoughts, as to thoſe that are practique; which will affect your heart, and not amaze the head. The Trinity in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Unity in Trinity hath in it amazing difficulties, ſuch as may puzle the profoundeſt wits; ſuch as I am not aſhamed (with <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>) to confeſs, I can neither ſatisfie my ſelf in, nor counſel others to ſearch after. An holy Circle of the humbleſt admiring and higheſt believing will beſt commed, in this
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:135216:208"/>an holy Chriſtian. Let your thoughts run backward and forward in this holy round, from believing forward to admiring, where your ſhort and ſtraitned reaſon cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend: And from admiring backward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to believing, becauſe Scripture Revelation hath made it clear.

               <p>Q. 3. <hi>How may we order our thoughts aright concerning theſe three diſtinct perſons as to Prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What hath been already premiſed, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the two former queſtions may perhaps ſeem enough to others for clearing of this alſo. Thither I muſt remit you in a great part for ſatisfaction, and ſhall only ſubjoyn theſe ſix enſuing propoſitions which will be of good and great uſe, if you therewith take in what hath been already tendered you, for the right directing of your Prayers to theſe divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (which as your late diſcourſe prompts me to think, was the great deſign you levelled at by this general queſtion) and for reſolving thoſe difficulties which ſeem to perplex you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. Though you are to diſtinguiſh the perſons, yet it is not your duty in prayer to preſent unto each perſon diſtinct petitions. I
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:135216:208"/>confeſs you may do it as <hi>Paul</hi> and the Prieſts ſometimes did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.24, 25, 26. But there is no command that you muſt do it, and if you conſult examples, you may find a whole conſtellation of Saints by whom it was not done; <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.1.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.20. ſee Q. 1. Prop. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Though the diſtinction of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould be preſerved, as in habit within your thoughts for the right preſenting of your Prayers; yet it is not your duty to put it forth into act, in every prayer you preſent. For 1. There is no command for it, either in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written book of nature, or in the written books of Scripture. <hi>And where there is no law there is no tranſgreſſion, Rom.</hi> 4.15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. 2. Your capacities being conſidered which are very ſtrait and narrow, it becomes incompoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with thoſe concerns of Prayer which you have in hand, to carry along a diſtinct view of theſe diſtinct perſons in every diſtinct Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You have a command 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do it all to the glory of God.</hi> An unintermitted intention of God, in every act of our lives, is granted to be neither need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nor poſſible. But if our intentions be (not formally and explicitely, but) only virtually and implicitely referred hither: ſo that we refer not any action to ſuch an end, as is not conſiſtent with this end, and that we actually refer all our actions to ſuch ends, as are in connexion with and in ſubordination to it; and if the habitual intention and reſpect of our
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:135216:209"/>hearts be toward God and his glory upmoſt, and theſe intentions be often actuated and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened. I ſay if it be thus, then have we E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelically ſatisfied this commandment. You will eaſily make application of what I have ſaid, to the illuſtration of this propoſition. Be ſure you do preſerve upon your thoughts the neceſſary diſtinction of theſe perſons, in the one only Godhead which is the object of Prayer, and though you do not explicitely mind their diſtinction in every Prayer; Yet let not your minds ſo fluctuate in any Prayer, as either to divide the Godhead or to exclude any perſon therein, or to confound all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in whatſoever Prayer, ſee <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Prop. 3, 4, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. It is requiſite, and (at leaſt) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the right directing of your Prayers, frequently to actuate ſuch thoughts in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the diſtinction of theſe perſons before Paayer. Becauſe this ſerves thereunto as a means to its end. There is not only a habitual, but an actual preparation of our ſelves prerequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Prayer, <hi>Job</hi> 11.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.1. The actual preſenting of the divine eſſence to our ſelves, and preſſing the glory thereof upon our Souls which eminently ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth forth in all theſe perſons, is admirably preparatory hereunto; and hath a powerful influence, <hi>per modum objecti</hi> upon our minds, wills and affections; both to fetch them off from other purſuits and objects, and to fix and unite them in, and to the preſent office; To allure the heart to draw nigh to him, to aw it
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:135216:209"/>with the dread of him, to advance it to a dependance on and delight in him, and to abaſe &amp; ſhame us in the ſenſe of our diſtance from him as Creatures, and the diſhonour we have done to him as ſinners: as you have ſeen (in effect) already, Qu. 2. Direct. 5. The Doctrine of the Trinity is as all Theological Doctrines are, a Practical Doctrine; The Scriptures propound it in order to Faith and Worſhip. Not one of theſe perſons, but is the object of both; as I have already proved, Q. 1. Prop. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. In actuating diſtinct thoughts upon theſe diſtinct perſons, in the undivided eſſence, we may read (and thence recollect) many incouragements and inducements to Prayer, both of petition and Praiſe. Think of them in their eſſentiall union, and whatſoever of obligation on inducement, an infinite, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, abſolute, allſufficient, moſt pure, moſt perfect goodneſs and truth may offer you for your incouragement in Prayer, here it is, your Faith may freely take it up and improve it. Think of them in their perſonal diſtinction. And here alſo what is there (rather, what is there not?) that may perſwade and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Prayer? Let me intimate a few things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Think you of God the Father? The thoughts of that very name cannot but take with an ingenuous nature, and will bring his Children with Reverence and with Confidence upon their knees as it did <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 3.14. But you muſt think further of him <hi>as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> (ibid.) This
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:135216:210"/>conſideration in confeſſion, will not only bend the knee but break the heart, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. This will immediately ſet the Soul a bleſſing of him: <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. Yea, and ſend your Soul a begging to him, and crying after him <hi>Abba Father, i.e.</hi> Father, Father, <hi>O that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mercies, would give unto you the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledg of him &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 4.6. Jer. 3.4. Eph. 1.17 &amp;c. Lo. 1. hence may your Soul reſume, he is my God and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This was that bleſſed news which <hi>Mary</hi> muſt bring from Chriſt to his Diſciples. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I aſcend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God, Joh.</hi> 20.17. 2. Hence may you Soul reaſon down all diſcouragements, 1. Why may I not adventure? tis not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſo much of a Judg as of a Father, is it not my Father that reacheth me out the Golden Scepter? There is ſomething of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he is my Father by Creation, the eyes of all may, and do wait upon him, and he gives them their meat in due ſeaſon. But how much more of encouragement is there, that he is the Father of Chriſt? my Father in my Chriſt. <hi>Here your faith may ſee boldneſs and acceſs, with confidence, by the faith of him, Eph.</hi> 3.12. 2. <hi>What may I not ask and have? He is able to do exceeding abundantly for me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that I can ask and think;</hi> who could beget an only begotten Son, in his own unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten nature &amp;c. yea, and he is willing too.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:135216:210"/>
                  <hi>He that ſpared not his Son, but delivered him up for us all: how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things, Eph.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32?</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Think you of God the Son? The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought of his relation to the Father will be taking and tranſporting to honour him, and it will be your honour. <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and ſheweth him all things that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth; hath committed all judgments unto the Son, that all men ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the Father: And if any ſerve me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>him will my Father honour; Job.</hi> 3.35.5, 20, 22, 23.12.26. What! the only begotten Son of the Father, the Angels wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him upon that account; and how ſhould we whoſe nature he took, for whoſe ſake he ſuffered, &amp;c. how ſhould we much more adore him, think of this Sonſhip? 1. It will afford you boldneſs in Prayer. You need not ſollicite the ſervants about the Court, Angels or Saints departed to preſent your petitions for you, the only begotten Son of the King of Kings, who is in the boſom of the Father, that hath his Fathers Eye, his Fathers Ear, his Fathers Heart, yea his Fathers Eſſence, <hi>bids you come with boldneſs &amp; in full aſſurance of faith by him;</hi> Tells you, <hi>that he will be your Advocate, and that he is now at the right hand of his Father your interceſſour, Eph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20, 22.7.25. 2. It may aſſure you the bleſſing prayed for. Can you think the Father will deny his only begotten Son? of the ſame mind, will, nature with himſelf? who taketh your petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of your hand (or heart rather) and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:135216:211"/>tenders them in your behalf unto his Father. <hi>All things that the Father hath are mine ſaith Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name he will give it you, ask and receive that your joy may be full, ver.</hi> 22, 23, <hi>c.</hi> 15.16. <hi>This comfort, this confidence have we that believe on the name of the Son of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Think you of God the Holy Ghoſt? <hi>Lo this is the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father;</hi> He proceedeth from, and is one with the Father and with the Son, and that to further your union and communion with himſelf and them: <hi>He is not only a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption to the Saints, but a Spirit of ſupplication in the Saints; Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. If the temptations of the fleſh pull you back, let the thoughts of the Spirit put and prick you on, that you make it a work not of formal ſaying, but of fervent praying; <hi>Praying in the Holy Ghoſt, Jude</hi> 20. The thoughts of him 1. Lead you to the origine of ability for prayer. Prayer is too hard for fleſh and blood; which therefore hangs backward: your thoughts now prompt you an omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent help. We know not either what we ought to pray for, or how to pray for it as we ought. Now the Spirit helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſtands as it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt us at the other end of the burden and puts under his ſhoulder with us, and ſo, we may carry the right of this duty cleverly and come off cherily, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. 2. Leave your hopes of the acceptance of your prayers.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:135216:211"/>This is not the Spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God. <hi>And God knoweth what is the mind of his own Spirit, who, for matter and manner maketh interceſſion in the Saints, as the Son doth for the Saints, according to the will of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. Nay this Spirit is God, exiſting in, and equal with the Father and the Son, in the ſame Godhead: And therefore God the Son cannot deny to tender, God the Father cannot deny to take what Prayers are preſented by you in the power of the Spirit. Let the thoughts of the Holy Ghoſt then be more frequent and familiar with you before prayer. The thoughts of him will put you at a greater diſtance from, and upon a greater defiance of your own fleſhly appetitions and inclinations in Prayer, will prompt you what you ſhould deſire in prayer, how, and for what, will put you into a more Spiritual frame and diſpoſition for Prayer; yea, and upon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a more abundant and efficacious influx and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; <hi>which your heavenly Father will be ſure to give unto them that ask him; Luk.</hi> 11.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. You may proportionably order your thoughts concerning theſe diſtinct perſons as to prayer, by conſidering of and conforming your Prayers to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct manner of their exiſtence and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Godhead which is the object of Prayer. The promiſſes make this
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:135216:212"/>plain enough without more proof. But it is needful that I Inſtance, and be more particular as to both their exiſtence and operation.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) As concerns the diſtinct manner of their ſubſiſting in the ſame Godhead, which hath been delivered you before on Qu. 2. This may direct you how to order your thoughts and their whole tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, both. 1. As to their perſons, 2. As to your praiſes and petitions, 3. And in or as to both, as the perſons are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with each other, in the ſame Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) As to theſe perſons. I adviſe you to apply your ſelf to the Father through the Son, by whom alone you can hope for acceptance, &amp; by the Spirit, from whom you muſt have ability and aſſiſtance. The Father is the firſt Perſon in order of theſe perſonal ſubſiſtants, that giveth ſubſiſting life both to Son and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The Son is the ſecond or middle Perſon ſubſiſting of and from the Father, and with the Father emitting or ſending forth the Spirit. The Spirit is the third and laſt in the order of theſe three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſubſiſting of and from them both; and ſent forth by both of them. So then though it be not always neceſſary to keep this order of the perſons in your mentions of them, in prayer to all three perſons; (becauſe you find clear precedents, by whom this order mentioned was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:135216:212"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4, 5.) Yet it is always neceſſary as to the inward manner and intentions of your mind, that your applications be by the ſpirit (by his aſſiſtance.) 2. through the Son (through his mediation, truſting by and for him to find acceptance) to the Father, (who through the Son and by the Spirit giveth out anſwers.) As the Apoſtle doth more than intimate, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Through him i.e.</hi> the Son, <hi>We have an acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) As to your praiſes and petitions. This lets you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e what a wide and an effectual door is opened to you. To ask from, and acknowledg to the Father all thoſe bleſſings, which come to you by his giving of the Son, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. And to Father and Son, whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are communicated to you, by their giving of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21, 22. So that you need not determine, nor ſhould limit your requeſts or thanks to that only perſon, from whom theſe bleſſings do in a more eſpecial manner proceed. The Father being the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of perſonal ſubſiſtence, all things are from him by the Son, and all things are referred back again by him to the Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. The Spirit ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting from both, and being ſent out by both referrs you back in all, both to Son and Father. <hi>John</hi> 16.13, 14, 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:135216:213"/>(3) As your prayers look upon all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as inſeparably united in the ſame eſſence. Learn to admire their mutual inexiſtence one in another, and in the ſame Godhead. Which our Saviours example in that ſolemn prayer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. may inſtruct you. <hi>As thou, O Father, art in me, and I in thee &amp;c.</hi> ver. 21. Think you upon the Father? Therewith admire and adore the Son; <hi>who is the brightneſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon, Heb.</hi> 1.3. Think you of the Son? therewith admire and adore the Father, <hi>He and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are one, Joh.</hi> 10.30. Think you of the Holy Ghoſt? Therewith admire and adore both Son and Father. <hi>He proceeds both from the Father and from the Son, Joh.</hi> 15.26. Think you of any? admire and adore all. <hi>They are all one eternal perfection, one God,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) As to the diſtinct manner of their working. What it is you have ſeen already, <hi>Q.</hi> 2. <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 4. The Son worketh from the Father, and the Spirit from them both. This directs you not only how to apply your ſelves to theſe perſons; (to the Father through the Son by the Spirit as before,) but alſo in and for what, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the more appropriate works of each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 'Tis true there is no work of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head without it ſelf, but it is common to, and predicable of every perſon in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. But yet (as ſome will obſerve) it is uſual in the Scriptures to aſcribe the former, middle, and latter part of theſe external works with proportion to the diſtinct order of theſe
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:135216:213"/>undivided agents. I inſtance the great work of mans Salvation. Our Salvation may be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently conſidered in three parts or ſteps, 1. The appointment, 2. The acquiſition, 3. The application of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The former part, the appointment of man to Salvation, Election which is the firſt ſtep is eminently aſcribed to the firſt perſon, the Father, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.4, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15.16 <hi>Who hath appointed us to Salvation by his Son, through Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.13 <hi>Elect according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of God the Father, through Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit, unto obedience and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſaith</hi> Peter, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. The Father then ſhould eminently have the glory of our election, in our prayers of thankſgiving as the Apoſtles render it him, ver. 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The middle part, the acquiſition of Salvation for man in redemption, is eminently aſcribed to the middle or ſecond perſon, the Son, who in the fulneſs of time was ſent forth from the Father, and offered up himſelf through the eternal Spirit, <hi>that he might obtain eternal redemption for us, and we might receive the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſons by him, Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12, 14. <hi>And ſo in him we have redemption through his blood,</hi> it being the blood, though of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, yet not of an humane but of a divine perſon, the Son of God, <hi>And ſo God is ſaid to purchaſe the Church with his own blood, Col.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. The Son then ſhould eminently have the glory of
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:135216:214"/>our redemption in our thankſgivings and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, as they give it him, <hi>Revela.</hi> 5.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The latter part, the application of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to man, which is begun in Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conſummate in Glorification, is eminently aſcribed to the laſt perſon, to the Holy Ghoſt, who is therefore called the Spirit of Holineſs, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. The Father predeſtinateth none to happineſs but through holineſs. The Son hath purchaſed happineſs for none but ſuch as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of holineſs. The Spirit, that proceedeth from the Father and the Son, printeth out their holy image upon us. <hi>And ſo we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according to the mercy of the Father, for the merit of the Son, by the waſhing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, and are now acceptable being ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. The Holy Ghoſt then ſhould eminently have the glory of our ſanctification, as alſo of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our ſouls and bodies, which is likewiſe by and from him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. You may piouſly direct your thoughts in Prayer, touching thoſe diſtinct perſons, by a deliberate view of what others have done in their applications to all thoſe perſons, and by doing accordingly. The laudable examples in Scriptures are left us for imitation in the like circumſtances. The bleſſing wherewith <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhall be the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:135216:214"/>only inſtance I will produce and proſecute: which will both give to, and receive light from the laſt propoſition. <hi>The Grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the love of the Father, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all. Amen.</hi> It is true, that Grace, Love, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion are not ſtrictly appropriated to any one of theſe perſons in the Scriptures. Yet the Apoſtle doth obſervably apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to theſe deſtinct perſons, with theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct petitions. And (no doubt) therefore we alſo may, to the Father in admiring and in asking of his love, to the Son in praying of and praying for his grace, to the Holy Ghoſt in beſeeching of and bleſſing him for his Communion.</p>
               <p>The Fathers love begins our felicity and ſalvation. There is his love of intention or benevolence, ordaining the end and us to the end, life and happineſs. There is his love of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution or beneficence, ordering out to us and beſtowing on us the means, that may bring us to this end. Both principal in giving his Son to redeem us, and his ſpirit to renew us, 2. And leſs principal, his Ordinances, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Word, Rod, &amp;c. let the Father be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, admired, adored in our prayers as to his love. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The grace of the Son doth (as it were) go on with our Felicity and Salvation, Grace abounds, ſuperabounds, reigns, through righteouſnes, unto Eternal Life; by
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:135216:215"/>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. The Son hath procured grace for us, redeeming us from guilt, reconciling us to God. The Son publiſheth grace to us, and is as it were a publick treaſury of grace for us; that of his fulneſs we may receive grace for grace. Come you then in your prayers to the Son for grace, celebrate the grace that is in and with the Son, and comes to you by the Son. I ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with your Spirit. Amen;</hi> As he often <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Philem.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>The Communion of the Holy Ghoſt is in conſummation of this happy enterprize begun. He it is that comes and applies all that good which a loving Father hath purpoſed to us, <hi>And all that grace which the everlaſting Son hath procured for us, and ſo giveth us fellowſhip with himſelf, with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16, 21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6. Breathe more after his Communion than in your prayers: Bleſs him more for this Communion in your praiſes. Let me only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you that this direction concerns you moſtly (if not only) when your prayers are directed to all three perſons, with diſtinct and expreſs mention as <hi>Pauls</hi> here were. It is high time to conclude.</p>
               <p>Happy, happy, happy, are thoſe Prayers which are terminated upon theſe three holy perſons, in one and the ſame infinitely holy Eſſence. The enjoyment of this trinune God by Faith, is the higheſt happineſs of the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:135216:215"/>Church militant. The enjoyment of this trinune God by ſight is the height of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Church Triumphant.</p>
